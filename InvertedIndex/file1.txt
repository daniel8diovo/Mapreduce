77	To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
78	
79	I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
80	
81	One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
82	
83	His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
84	
85	"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
86	
87	"Seven!" I answered.
88	
89	"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."
90	
91	"Then, how do you know?"
92	
93	"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"
94	
95	"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."
96	
97	He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
98	
99	"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."
100	
101	I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."
102	
103	"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
104	
105	"Frequently."
106	
107	"How often?"
108	
109	"Well, some hundreds of times."
110	
111	"Then how many are there?"
112	
113	"How many? I don't know."
114	
115	"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."
116	
117	The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
118	
119	"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."
120	
121	"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"
122	
123	"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?"
124	
125	I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.
126	
127	"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."
128	
129	"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."
130	
131	I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
132	
133	"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
134	
135	"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
136	
137	"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
138	
139	"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
140	
141	"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
142	
143	As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.
144	
145	"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
146	
147	"I think that I had better go, Holmes."
148	
149	"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."
150	
151	"But your client--"
152	
153	"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."
154	
155	A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.
156	
157	"Come in!" said Holmes.
158	
159	A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
160	
161	"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
162	
163	"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"
164	
165	"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."
166	
167	I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
168	
169	The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."
170	
171	"I promise," said Holmes.
172	
173	"And I."
174	
175	"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."
176	
177	"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
178	
179	"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."
180	
181	"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
182	
183	Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
184	
185	"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."
186	
187	The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"
188	
189	"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."
190	
191	"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."
192	
193	"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
194	
195	"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."
196	
197	"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
198	
199	"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."
200	
201	"Precisely so. But how--"
202	
203	"Was there a secret marriage?"
204	
205	"None."
206	
207	"No legal papers or certificates?"
208	
209	"None."
210	
211	"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"
212	
213	"There is the writing."
214	
215	"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."
216	
217	"My private note-paper."
218	
219	"Stolen."
220	
221	"My own seal."
222	
223	"Imitated."
224	
225	"My photograph."
226	
227	"Bought."
228	
229	"We were both in the photograph."
230	
231	"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."
232	
233	"I was mad--insane."
234	
235	"You have compromised yourself seriously."
236	
237	"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."
238	
239	"It must be recovered."
240	
241	"We have tried and failed."
242	
243	"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."
244	
245	"She will not sell."
246	
247	"Stolen, then."
248	
249	"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result."
250	
251	"No sign of it?"
252	
253	"Absolutely none."
254	
255	Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.
256	
257	"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.
258	
259	"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"
260	
261	"To ruin me."
262	
263	"But how?"
264	
265	"I am about to be married."
266	
267	"So I have heard."
268	
269	"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."
270	
271	"And Irene Adler?"
272	
273	"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."
274	
275	"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
276	
277	"I am sure."
278	
279	"And why?"
280	
281	"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."
282	
283	"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"
284	
285	"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm."
286	
287	"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
288	
289	"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."
290	
291	"Then, as to money?"
292	
293	"You have carte blanche."
294	
295	"Absolutely?"
296	
297	"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."
298	
299	"And for present expenses?"
300	
301	The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.
302	
303	"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.
304	
305	Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.
306	
307	"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
308	
309	"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."
310	
311	Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"
312	
313	"It was."
314	
315	"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
316	
317	II.
318	
319	
320	At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
321	
322	It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
323	
324	"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
325	
326	"What is it?"
327	
328	"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."
329	
330	"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."
331	
332	"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.
333	
334	"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."
335	
336	"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.
337	
338	"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.
339	
340	"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."
341	
342	"I am following you closely," I answered.
343	
344	"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.
345	
346	"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'
347	
348	"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
349	
350	" 'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
351	
352	"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
353	
354	"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.
355	
356	" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'
357	
358	" 'What then?' I asked.
359	
360	" 'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
361	
362	"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."
363	
364	"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"
365	
366	"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."
367	
368	"Which are?"
369	
370	"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."
371	
372	"I shall be delighted."
373	
374	"You don't mind breaking the law?"
375	
376	"Not in the least."
377	
378	"Nor running a chance of arrest?"
379	
380	"Not in a good cause."
381	
382	"Oh, the cause is excellent!"
383	
384	"Then I am your man."
385	
386	"I was sure that I might rely on you."
387	
388	"But what is it you wish?"
389	
390	"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
391	
392	"And what then?"
393	
394	"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"
395	
396	"I am to be neutral?"
397	
398	"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."
399	
400	"Yes."
401	
402	"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
403	
404	"Yes."
405	
406	"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?"
407	
408	"Entirely."
409	
410	"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"
411	
412	"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
413	
414	"Precisely."
415	
416	"Then you may entirely rely on me."
417	
418	"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play."
419	
420	He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.
421	
422	It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.
423	
424	"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"
425	
426	"Where, indeed?"
427	
428	"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."
429	
430	"Where, then?"
431	
432	"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."
433	
434	"But it has twice been burgled."
435	
436	"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."
437	
438	"But how will you look?"
439	
440	"I will not look."
441	
442	"What then?"
443	
444	"I will get her to show me."
445	
446	"But she will refuse."
447	
448	"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."
449	
450	As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.
451	
452	"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.
453	
454	"He is dead," cried several voices.
455	
456	"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."
457	
458	"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."
459	
460	"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"
461	
462	"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"
463	
464	Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.
465	
466	Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.
467	
468	"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right."
469	
470	"You have the photograph?"
471	
472	"I know where it is."
473	
474	"And how did you find out?"
475	
476	"She showed me, as I told you she would."
477	
478	"I am still in the dark."
479	
480	"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."
481	
482	"I guessed as much."
483	
484	"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."
485	
486	"That also I could fathom."
487	
488	"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."
489	
490	"How did that help you?"
491	
492	"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
493	
494	"And now?" I asked.
495	
496	"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."
497	
498	"And when will you call?"
499	
500	"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay."
501	
502	We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
503	
504	"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
505	
506	There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
507	
508	"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been."
509	
510	III.
511	
512	
513	I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.
514	
515	"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
516	
517	"Not yet."
518	
519	"But you have hopes?"
520	
521	"I have hopes."
522	
523	"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."
524	
525	"We must have a cab."
526	
527	"No, my brougham is waiting."
528	
529	"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.
530	
531	"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
532	
533	"Married! When?"
534	
535	"Yesterday."
536	
537	"But to whom?"
538	
539	"To an English lawyer named Norton."
540	
541	"But she could not love him."
542	
543	"I am in hopes that she does."
544	
545	"And why in hopes?"
546	
547	"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
548	
549	"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.
550	
551	The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.
552	
553	"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
554	
555	"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.
556	
557	"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent."
558	
559	"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"
560	
561	"Never to return."
562	
563	"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."
564	
565	"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
566	
567	"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.
568	
569	"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.
570	
571	"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
572	
573	
574	"Very truly yours,              
575	"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."
576	
577	"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
578	
579	"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."
580	
581	"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
582	
583	"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."
584	
585	"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
586	
587	"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.
588	
589	"You have but to name it."
590	
591	"This photograph!"
592	
593	The King stared at him in amazement.
594	
595	"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."
596	
597	"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning." He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
598	
599	And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.
600	
601	ADVENTURE  II.  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
602	
603	
604	I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
605	
606	"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.
607	
608	"I was afraid that you were engaged."
609	
610	"So I am. Very much so."
611	
612	"Then I can wait in the next room."
613	
614	"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."
615	
616	The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.
617	
618	"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."
619	
620	"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.
621	
622	"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."
623	
624	"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."
625	
626	"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
627	
628	The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
629	
630	I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.
631	
632	Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."
633	
634	Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
635	
636	"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."
637	
638	"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."
639	
640	"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
641	
642	"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."
643	
644	"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"
645	
646	"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
647	
648	"Well, but China?"
649	
650	"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."
651	
652	Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."
653	
654	"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"
655	
656	"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."
657	
658	I took the paper from him and read as follows:
659	
660	"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."
661	
662	"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.
663	
664	Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."
665	
666	"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."
667	
668	"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"
669	
670	"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."
671	
672	"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
673	
674	"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
675	
676	"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."
677	
678	"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."
679	
680	"He is still with you, I presume?"
681	
682	"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.
683	
684	"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:
685	
686	" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'
687	
688	" 'Why that?' I asks.
689	
690	" 'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'
691	
692	" 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.
693	
694	" 'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open.
695	
696	" 'Never.'
697	
698	" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'
699	
700	" 'And what are they worth?' I asked.
701	
702	" 'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'
703	
704	"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.
705	
706	" 'Tell me all about it,' said I.
707	
708	" 'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.'
709	
710	" 'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'
711	
712	" 'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'
713	
714	"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
715	
716	"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."
717	
718	"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
719	
720	"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.
721	
722	" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'
723	
724	" 'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.
725	
726	" 'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.
727	
728	" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'
729	
730	"I answered that I had not.
731	
732	"His face fell immediately.
733	
734	" 'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'
735	
736	"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.
737	
738	" 'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'
739	
740	" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.
741	
742	" 'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'
743	
744	" 'What would be the hours?' I asked.
745	
746	" 'Ten to two.'
747	
748	"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.
749	
750	" 'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'
751	
752	" 'Is $4 a week.'
753	
754	" 'And the work?'
755	
756	" 'Is purely nominal.'
757	
758	" 'What do you call purely nominal?'
759	
760	" 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'
761	
762	" 'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.
763	
764	" 'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'
765	
766	" 'And the work?'
767	
768	" 'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'
769	
770	" 'Certainly,' I answered.
771	
772	" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.
773	
774	"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.
775	
776	"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.
777	
778	"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.
779	
780	"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."
781	
782	"To an end?"
783	
784	"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
785	
786	He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:
787	
788	
789	THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
790	
791	IS
792	
793	DISSOLVED.
794	
795	October 9, 1890.
796	
797	
798	Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.
799	
800	"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."
801	
802	"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"
803	
804	"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.
805	
806	" 'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'
807	
808	" 'What, the red-headed man?'
809	
810	" 'Yes.'
811	
812	" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'
813	
814	" 'Where could I find him?'
815	
816	" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'
817	
818	"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."
819	
820	"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.
821	
822	"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."
823	
824	"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."
825	
826	"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."
827	
828	"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."
829	
830	"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."
831	
832	"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"
833	
834	"About a month then."
835	
836	"How did he come?"
837	
838	"In answer to an advertisement."
839	
840	"Was he the only applicant?"
841	
842	"No, I had a dozen."
843	
844	"Why did you pick him?"
845	
846	"Because he was handy and would come cheap."
847	
848	"At half wages, in fact."
849	
850	"Yes."
851	
852	"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
853	
854	"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."
855	
856	Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"
857	
858	"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."
859	
860	"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"
861	
862	"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
863	
864	"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"
865	
866	"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."
867	
868	"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
869	
870	"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"
871	
872	"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."
873	
874	"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."
875	
876	"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
877	
878	"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
879	
880	"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"
881	
882	"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."
883	
884	"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"
885	
886	We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.
887	
888	"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."
889	
890	"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.
891	
892	"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before."
893	
894	"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
895	
896	"Not him."
897	
898	"What then?"
899	
900	"The knees of his trousers."
901	
902	"And what did you see?"
903	
904	"What I expected to see."
905	
906	"Why did you beat the pavement?"
907	
908	"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
909	
910	The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.
911	
912	"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."
913	
914	My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.
915	
916	"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.
917	
918	"Yes, it would be as well."
919	
920	"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."
921	
922	"Why serious?"
923	
924	"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."
925	
926	"At what time?"
927	
928	"Ten will be early enough."
929	
930	"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."
931	
932	"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
933	
934	I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.
935	
936	It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.
937	
938	"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."
939	
940	"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."
941	
942	"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
943	
944	"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."
945	
946	"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."
947	
948	"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
949	
950	"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."
951	
952	"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."
953	
954	Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.
955	
956	"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."
957	
958	We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
959	
960	"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.
961	
962	"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
963	
964	"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
965	
966	The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
967	
968	"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."
969	
970	"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."
971	
972	"Your French gold?"
973	
974	"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."
975	
976	"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
977	
978	"And sit in the dark?"
979	
980	"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."
981	
982	I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.
983	
984	"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"
985	
986	"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."
987	
988	"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."
989	
990	What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.
991	
992	At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.
993	
994	Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.
995	
996	"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"
997	
998	Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
999	
1000	"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no chance at all."
1001	
1002	"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."
1003	
1004	"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.
1005	
1006	"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."
1007	
1008	"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."
1009	
1010	"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."
1011	
1012	"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.' "
1013	
1014	"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"
1015	
1016	"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
1017	
1018	"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."
1019	
1020	"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."
1021	
1022	"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."
1023	
1024	"But how could you guess what the motive was?"
1025	
1026	"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.
1027	
1028	"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."
1029	
1030	"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.
1031	
1032	"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
1033	
1034	"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."
1035	
1036	"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so."
1037	
1038	"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.
1039	
1040	He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. " 'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."
1041	
1042	ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY
1043	
1044	
1045	"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."
1046	
1047	"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."
1048	
1049	"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."
1050	
1051	I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."
1052	
1053	"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."
1054	
1055	He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.
1056	
1057	"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."
1058	
1059	"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.
1060	
1061	"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."
1062	
1063	"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.
1064	
1065	"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."
1066	
1067	He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.
1068	
1069	"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."
1070	
1071	As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.
1072	
1073	"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"
1074	
1075	"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"
1076	
1077	"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"
1078	
1079	"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."
1080	
1081	"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.
1082	
1083	Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."
1084	
1085	"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."
1086	
1087	"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."
1088	
1089	"And your mother is alive?"
1090	
1091	"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."
1092	
1093	I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
1094	
1095	"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"
1096	
1097	"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."
1098	
1099	"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60."
1100	
1101	"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
1102	
1103	"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
1104	
1105	A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
1106	
1107	"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."
1108	
1109	"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
1110	
1111	"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
1112	
1113	"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."
1114	
1115	"No?"
1116	
1117	"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."
1118	
1119	"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"
1120	
1121	"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."
1122	
1123	"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"
1124	
1125	"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"
1126	
1127	"What office?"
1128	
1129	"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."
1130	
1131	"Where did he live, then?"
1132	
1133	"He slept on the premises."
1134	
1135	"And you don't know his address?"
1136	
1137	"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."
1138	
1139	"Where did you address your letters, then?"
1140	
1141	"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."
1142	
1143	"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
1144	
1145	"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."
1146	
1147	"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"
1148	
1149	"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."
1150	
1151	"It missed him, then?"
1152	
1153	"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."
1154	
1155	"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"
1156	
1157	"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."
1158	
1159	"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.
1160	
1161	"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."
1162	
1163	"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"
1164	
1165	"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened."
1166	
1167	"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"
1168	
1169	"None."
1170	
1171	"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"
1172	
1173	"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."
1174	
1175	"And your father? Did you tell him?"
1176	
1177	"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.
1178	
1179	"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
1180	
1181	"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"
1182	
1183	"I fear not."
1184	
1185	"Then what has happened to him?"
1186	
1187	"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare."
1188	
1189	"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."
1190	
1191	"Thank you. And your address?"
1192	
1193	"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
1194	
1195	"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"
1196	
1197	"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."
1198	
1199	"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."
1200	
1201	"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."
1202	
1203	For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.
1204	
1205	Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.
1206	
1207	"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive."
1208	
1209	"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.
1210	
1211	"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."
1212	
1213	"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."
1214	
1215	Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
1216	
1217	" 'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."
1218	
1219	"It surprised me."
1220	
1221	"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."
1222	
1223	"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.
1224	
1225	"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
1226	
1227	I held the little printed slip to the light.
1228	
1229	"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"
1230	
1231	"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."
1232	
1233	"They are typewritten," I remarked.
1234	
1235	"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."
1236	
1237	"Of what?"
1238	
1239	"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"
1240	
1241	"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted."
1242	
1243	"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."
1244	
1245	I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.
1246	
1247	I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.
1248	
1249	A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.
1250	
1251	"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.
1252	
1253	"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."
1254	
1255	"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.
1256	
1257	"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."
1258	
1259	"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"
1260	
1261	The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.
1262	
1263	"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"
1264	
1265	The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
1266	
1267	"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"
1268	
1269	"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"
1270	
1271	"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
1272	
1273	Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.
1274	
1275	"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."
1276	
1277	"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
1278	
1279	"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."
1280	
1281	Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."
1282	
1283	"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"
1284	
1285	"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
1286	
1287	"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk it over."
1288	
1289	Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.
1290	
1291	"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."
1292	
1293	The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.
1294	
1295	"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."
1296	
1297	"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been so carried away."
1298	
1299	"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"
1300	
1301	Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.
1302	
1303	"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."
1304	
1305	"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.
1306	
1307	"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."
1308	
1309	"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I remarked.
1310	
1311	"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."
1312	
1313	"And how did you verify them?"
1314	
1315	"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!"
1316	
1317	"And Miss Sutherland?"
1318	
1319	"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."
1320	
1321	ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
1322	
1323	
1324	We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:
1325	
1326	"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."
1327	
1328	"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will you go?"
1329	
1330	"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present."
1331	
1332	"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."
1333	
1334	"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour."
1335	
1336	My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
1337	
1338	"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets."
1339	
1340	We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.
1341	
1342	"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.
1343	
1344	"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."
1345	
1346	"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."
1347	
1348	"That sounds a little paradoxical."
1349	
1350	"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man."
1351	
1352	"It is a murder, then?"
1353	
1354	"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.
1355	
1356	"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.
1357	
1358	"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.
1359	
1360	"From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
1361	
1362	"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."
1363	
1364	"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."
1365	
1366	"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."
1367	
1368	"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case."
1369	
1370	"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that."
1371	
1372	"How on earth--"
1373	
1374	"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering."
1375	
1376	"What are they?"
1377	
1378	"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury."
1379	
1380	"It was a confession," I ejaculated.
1381	
1382	"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."
1383	
1384	"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."
1385	
1386	"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."
1387	
1388	I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.
1389	
1390	"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."
1391	
1392	"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"
1393	
1394	"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."
1395	
1396	He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:
1397	
1398	"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'
1399	
1400	"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?
1401	
1402	"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.
1403	
1404	"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?
1405	
1406	"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.
1407	
1408	"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?
1409	
1410	"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
1411	
1412	"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
1413	
1414	"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.
1415	
1416	"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.
1417	
1418	"Witness: I must still refuse.
1419	
1420	"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father?
1421	
1422	"Witness: It was.
1423	
1424	"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
1425	
1426	"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
1427	
1428	"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?
1429	
1430	"Witness: Nothing definite.
1431	
1432	"The Coroner: What do you mean?
1433	
1434	"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.
1435	
1436	" 'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'
1437	
1438	" 'Yes, it was gone.'
1439	
1440	" 'You cannot say what it was?'
1441	
1442	" 'No, I had a feeling something was there.'
1443	
1444	" 'How far from the body?'
1445	
1446	" 'A dozen yards or so.'
1447	
1448	" 'And how far from the edge of the wood?'
1449	
1450	" 'About the same.'
1451	
1452	" 'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?'
1453	
1454	" 'Yes, but with my back towards it.'
1455	
1456	"This concluded the examination of the witness."
1457	
1458	"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."
1459	
1460	Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."
1461	
1462	It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.
1463	
1464	"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."
1465	
1466	"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."
1467	
1468	Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.
1469	
1470	"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."
1471	
1472	Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door."
1473	
1474	He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.
1475	
1476	"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
1477	
1478	"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."
1479	
1480	"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"
1481	
1482	"I think that it is very probable."
1483	
1484	"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."
1485	
1486	Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.
1487	
1488	"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it."
1489	
1490	"In what way?" asked Holmes.
1491	
1492	"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."
1493	
1494	"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a union?"
1495	
1496	"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.
1497	
1498	"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father if I call to-morrow?"
1499	
1500	"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."
1501	
1502	"The doctor?"
1503	
1504	"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."
1505	
1506	"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."
1507	
1508	"Yes, at the mines."
1509	
1510	"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."
1511	
1512	"Yes, certainly."
1513	
1514	"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me."
1515	
1516	"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."
1517	
1518	"I will, Miss Turner."
1519	
1520	"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
1521	
1522	"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel."
1523	
1524	"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"
1525	
1526	"Yes, but only for you and me."
1527	
1528	"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"
1529	
1530	"Ample."
1531	
1532	"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."
1533	
1534	I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.
1535	
1536	It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
1537	
1538	"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy."
1539	
1540	"And what did you learn from him?"
1541	
1542	"Nothing."
1543	
1544	"Could he throw no light?"
1545	
1546	"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."
1547	
1548	"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner."
1549	
1550	"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered."
1551	
1552	"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
1553	
1554	"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow."
1555	
1556	There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.
1557	
1558	"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of."
1559	
1560	"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.
1561	
1562	"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."
1563	
1564	"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.
1565	
1566	"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him."
1567	
1568	"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?"
1569	
1570	"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."
1571	
1572	"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard to tackle the facts."
1573	
1574	"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.
1575	
1576	"And that is--"
1577	
1578	"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."
1579	
1580	"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes, laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left."
1581	
1582	"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
1583	
1584	Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.
1585	
1586	The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.
1587	
1588	"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.
1589	
1590	"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth--"
1591	
1592	"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.
1593	
1594	"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently."
1595	
1596	It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.
1597	
1598	"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "The murder was done with it."
1599	
1600	"I see no marks."
1601	
1602	"There are none."
1603	
1604	"How do you know, then?"
1605	
1606	"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon."
1607	
1608	"And the murderer?"
1609	
1610	"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."
1611	
1612	Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury."
1613	
1614	"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train."
1615	
1616	"And leave your case unfinished?"
1617	
1618	"No, finished."
1619	
1620	"But the mystery?"
1621	
1622	"It is solved."
1623	
1624	"Who was the criminal, then?"
1625	
1626	"The gentleman I describe."
1627	
1628	"But who is he?"
1629	
1630	"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood."
1631	
1632	Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."
1633	
1634	"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave."
1635	
1636	Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.
1637	
1638	"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound."
1639	
1640	"Pray do so."
1641	
1642	"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."
1643	
1644	"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"
1645	
1646	"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia."
1647	
1648	"What of the rat, then?"
1649	
1650	Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand over part of the map. "What do you read?"
1651	
1652	"ARAT," I read.
1653	
1654	"And now?" He raised his hand.
1655	
1656	"BALLARAT."
1657	
1658	"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."
1659	
1660	"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.
1661	
1662	"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."
1663	
1664	"Certainly."
1665	
1666	"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander."
1667	
1668	"Quite so."
1669	
1670	"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."
1671	
1672	"But how did you gain them?"
1673	
1674	"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles."
1675	
1676	"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."
1677	
1678	"Yes, they were peculiar boots."
1679	
1680	"But his lameness?"
1681	
1682	"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he was lame."
1683	
1684	"But his left-handedness."
1685	
1686	"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam."
1687	
1688	"And the cigar-holder?"
1689	
1690	"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."
1691	
1692	"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"
1693	
1694	"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
1695	
1696	The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.
1697	
1698	"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my note?"
1699	
1700	"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal."
1701	
1702	"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."
1703	
1704	"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.
1705	
1706	"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It is so. I know all about McCarthy."
1707	
1708	The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried. "But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes."
1709	
1710	"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.
1711	
1712	"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested."
1713	
1714	"It may not come to that," said Holmes.
1715	
1716	"What?"
1717	
1718	"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however."
1719	
1720	"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."
1721	
1722	Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."
1723	
1724	"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.
1725	
1726	"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.
1727	
1728	"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
1729	
1730	"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
1731	
1732	"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.
1733	
1734	" 'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman within hail.'
1735	
1736	"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.
1737	
1738	"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.
1739	
1740	"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred."
1741	
1742	"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation."
1743	
1744	"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"
1745	
1746	"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us."
1747	
1748	"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
1749	
1750	"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.' "
1751	
1752	James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.

1754	ADVENTURE  V.  THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
1755	
1756	
1757	When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.
1758	
1759	The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
1760	
1761	It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.
1762	
1763	"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"
1764	
1765	"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage visitors."
1766	
1767	"A client, then?"
1768	
1769	"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's."
1770	
1771	Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
1772	
1773	"Come in!" said he.
1774	
1775	The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.
1776	
1777	"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber."
1778	
1779	"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see."
1780	
1781	"Yes, from Horsham."
1782	
1783	"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive."
1784	
1785	"I have come for advice."
1786	
1787	"That is easily got."
1788	
1789	"And help."
1790	
1791	"That is not always so easy."
1792	
1793	"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."
1794	
1795	"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."
1796	
1797	"He said that you could solve anything."
1798	
1799	"He said too much."
1800	
1801	"That you are never beaten."
1802	
1803	"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman."
1804	
1805	"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"
1806	
1807	"It is true that I have been generally successful."
1808	
1809	"Then you may be so with me."
1810	
1811	"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case."
1812	
1813	"It is no ordinary one."
1814	
1815	"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal."
1816	
1817	"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family."
1818	
1819	"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important."
1820	
1821	The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.
1822	
1823	"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.
1824	
1825	"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.
1826	
1827	"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.
1828	
1829	"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.
1830	
1831	"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'
1832	
1833	" 'What is it, uncle?' I cried.
1834	
1835	" 'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
1836	
1837	" 'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,' said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'
1838	
1839	"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.
1840	
1841	" 'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.'
1842	
1843	"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.
1844	
1845	"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some $14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank."
1846	
1847	"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide."
1848	
1849	"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd."
1850	
1851	"Thank you. Pray proceed."
1852	
1853	"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.
1854	
1855	"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.
1856	
1857	" 'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.
1858	
1859	"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.
1860	
1861	"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?'
1862	
1863	" 'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder.
1864	
1865	" 'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.
1866	
1867	" 'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.'
1868	
1869	" 'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?'
1870	
1871	" 'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.
1872	
1873	" 'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.'
1874	
1875	" 'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.
1876	
1877	" 'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'
1878	
1879	" 'Then let me do so?'
1880	
1881	" 'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.'
1882	
1883	"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.
1884	
1885	"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
1886	
1887	"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.
1888	
1889	"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father."
1890	
1891	The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.
1892	
1893	"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on the sundial.' "
1894	
1895	"What have you done?" asked Holmes.
1896	
1897	"Nothing."
1898	
1899	"Nothing?"
1900	
1901	"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against."
1902	
1903	"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair."
1904	
1905	"I have seen the police."
1906	
1907	"Ah!"
1908	
1909	"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings."
1910	
1911	Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible imbecility!" he cried.
1912	
1913	"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me."
1914	
1915	"Has he come with you to-night?"
1916	
1917	"No. His orders were to stay in the house."
1918	
1919	Again Holmes raved in the air.
1920	
1921	"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not come at once?"
1922	
1923	"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you."
1924	
1925	"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which might help us?"
1926	
1927	"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance," said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."
1928	
1929	Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:
1930	
1931	"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
1932	
1933	"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and
1934	
1935	        John Swain, of St. Augustine.
1936	
1937	"9th. McCauley cleared.
1938	
1939	"10th. John Swain cleared.
1940	
1941	"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."
1942	
1943	"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act."
1944	
1945	"What shall I do?"
1946	
1947	"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?"
1948	
1949	"Entirely."
1950	
1951	"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties."
1952	
1953	"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise."
1954	
1955	"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?"
1956	
1957	"By train from Waterloo."
1958	
1959	"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."
1960	
1961	"I am armed."
1962	
1963	"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."
1964	
1965	"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"
1966	
1967	"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it."
1968	
1969	"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.
1970	
1971	Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
1972	
1973	"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this."
1974	
1975	"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."
1976	
1977	"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos."
1978	
1979	"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?"
1980	
1981	"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.
1982	
1983	"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?"
1984	
1985	Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion."
1986	
1987	"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis."
1988	
1989	Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?"
1990	
1991	"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London."
1992	
1993	"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"
1994	
1995	"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."
1996	
1997	"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?"
1998	
1999	"A greater distance to travel."
2000	
2001	"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."
2002	
2003	"Then I do not see the point."
2004	
2005	"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer."
2006	
2007	"It is possible."
2008	
2009	"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."
2010	
2011	"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?"
2012	
2013	"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society."
2014	
2015	"But of what society?"
2016	
2017	"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"
2018	
2019	"I never have."
2020	
2021	Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it is," said he presently:
2022	
2023	" 'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'
2024	
2025	"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."
2026	
2027	"Then the page we have seen--"
2028	
2029	"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men."
2030	
2031	It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.
2032	
2033	"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw's."
2034	
2035	"What steps will you take?" I asked.
2036	
2037	"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."
2038	
2039	"You will not go there first?"
2040	
2041	"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee."
2042	
2043	As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.
2044	
2045	"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."
2046	
2047	"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
2048	
2049	"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:
2050	
2051	" 'Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.' "
2052	
2053	We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.
2054	
2055	"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.
2056	
2057	"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"
2058	
2059	"To the police?"
2060	
2061	"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before."
2062	
2063	All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.
2064	
2065	"You are hungry," I remarked.
2066	
2067	"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast."
2068	
2069	"Nothing?"
2070	
2071	"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."
2072	
2073	"And how have you succeeded?"
2074	
2075	"Well."
2076	
2077	"You have a clue?"
2078	
2079	"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"
2080	
2081	"What do you mean?"
2082	
2083	He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia."
2084	
2085	"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."
2086	
2087	"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"
2088	
2089	"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."
2090	
2091	"How did you trace it, then?"
2092	
2093	He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.
2094	
2095	"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union."
2096	
2097	"Texas, I think."
2098	
2099	"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin."
2100	
2101	"What then?"
2102	
2103	"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London."
2104	
2105	"Yes?"
2106	
2107	"The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."
2108	
2109	"What will you do, then?"
2110	
2111	"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."
2112	
2113	There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.
2114	
2115	ADVENTURE  VI.  THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
2116	
2117	
2118	Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
2119	
2120	One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.
2121	
2122	"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."
2123	
2124	I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
2125	
2126	We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
2127	
2128	"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."
2129	
2130	"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in."
2131	
2132	"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.
2133	
2134	"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"
2135	
2136	"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!"
2137	
2138	It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?
2139	
2140	It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
2141	
2142	There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.
2143	
2144	But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.
2145	
2146	Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.
2147	
2148	As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
2149	
2150	"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."
2151	
2152	There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.
2153	
2154	"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what o'clock is it?"
2155	
2156	"Nearly eleven."
2157	
2158	"Of what day?"
2159	
2160	"Of Friday, June 19th."
2161	
2162	"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.
2163	
2164	"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
2165	
2166	"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"
2167	
2168	"Yes, I have one waiting."
2169	
2170	"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."
2171	
2172	I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
2173	
2174	"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"
2175	
2176	"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you."
2177	
2178	"I have a cab outside."
2179	
2180	"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."
2181	
2182	It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.
2183	
2184	"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views."
2185	
2186	"I was certainly surprised to find you there."
2187	
2188	"But not more so than I to find you."
2189	
2190	"I came to find a friend."
2191	
2192	"And I to find an enemy."
2193	
2194	"An enemy?"
2195	
2196	"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights."
2197	
2198	"What! You do not mean bodies?"
2199	
2200	"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.
2201	
2202	"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"
2203	
2204	"If I can be of use."
2205	
2206	"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."
2207	
2208	"The Cedars?"
2209	
2210	"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry."
2211	
2212	"Where is it, then?"
2213	
2214	"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."
2215	
2216	"But I am all in the dark."
2217	
2218	"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!"
2219	
2220	He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.
2221	
2222	"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."
2223	
2224	"You forget that I know nothing about it."
2225	
2226	"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me."
2227	
2228	"Proceed, then."
2229	
2230	"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to $88 10s., while he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.
2231	
2232	"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?"
2233	
2234	"It is very clear."
2235	
2236	"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.
2237	
2238	"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.
2239	
2240	"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.
2241	
2242	"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes.
2243	
2244	"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."
2245	
2246	"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?"
2247	
2248	"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others."
2249	
2250	"Pray continue your narrative."
2251	
2252	"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.
2253	
2254	"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?"
2255	
2256	"I cannot imagine."
2257	
2258	"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river."
2259	
2260	"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"
2261	
2262	"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."
2263	
2264	"It certainly sounds feasible."
2265	
2266	"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."
2267	
2268	While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
2269	
2270	"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."
2271	
2272	"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.
2273	
2274	"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"
2275	
2276	We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.
2277	
2278	"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
2279	
2280	"No good news?"
2281	
2282	"None."
2283	
2284	"No bad?"
2285	
2286	"No."
2287	
2288	"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day."
2289	
2290	"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation."
2291	
2292	"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly. "You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us."
2293	
2294	"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy."
2295	
2296	"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer."
2297	
2298	"Certainly, madam."
2299	
2300	"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."
2301	
2302	"Upon what point?"
2303	
2304	"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"
2305	
2306	Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. "Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
2307	
2308	"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."
2309	
2310	"You think that he is dead?"
2311	
2312	"I do."
2313	
2314	"Murdered?"
2315	
2316	"I don't say that. Perhaps."
2317	
2318	"And on what day did he meet his death?"
2319	
2320	"On Monday."
2321	
2322	"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."
2323	
2324	Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.
2325	
2326	"What!" he roared.
2327	
2328	"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.
2329	
2330	"May I see it?"
2331	
2332	"Certainly."
2333	
2334	He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.
2335	
2336	"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your husband's writing, madam."
2337	
2338	"No, but the enclosure is."
2339	
2340	"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address."
2341	
2342	"How can you tell that?"
2343	
2344	"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!"
2345	
2346	"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."
2347	
2348	"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"
2349	
2350	"One of his hands."
2351	
2352	"One?"
2353	
2354	"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well."
2355	
2356	" 'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?"
2357	
2358	"None. Neville wrote those words."
2359	
2360	"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over."
2361	
2362	"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."
2363	
2364	"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him."
2365	
2366	"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"
2367	
2368	"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day."
2369	
2370	"That is possible."
2371	
2372	"If so, much may have happened between."
2373	
2374	"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"
2375	
2376	"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?"
2377	
2378	"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."
2379	
2380	"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"
2381	
2382	"No."
2383	
2384	"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"
2385	
2386	"Very much so."
2387	
2388	"Was the window open?"
2389	
2390	"Yes."
2391	
2392	"Then he might have called to you?"
2393	
2394	"He might."
2395	
2396	"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"
2397	
2398	"Yes."
2399	
2400	"A call for help, you thought?"
2401	
2402	"Yes. He waved his hands."
2403	
2404	"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"
2405	
2406	"It is possible."
2407	
2408	"And you thought he was pulled back?"
2409	
2410	"He disappeared so suddenly."
2411	
2412	"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?"
2413	
2414	"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."
2415	
2416	"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?"
2417	
2418	"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat."
2419	
2420	"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"
2421	
2422	"Never."
2423	
2424	"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"
2425	
2426	"Never."
2427	
2428	"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow."
2429	
2430	A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
2431	
2432	"Awake, Watson?" he asked.
2433	
2434	"Yes."
2435	
2436	"Game for a morning drive?"
2437	
2438	"Certainly."
2439	
2440	"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
2441	
2442	As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.
2443	
2444	"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now."
2445	
2446	"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.
2447	
2448	"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock."
2449	
2450	We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.
2451	
2452	"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."
2453	
2454	In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.
2455	
2456	"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.
2457	
2458	"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."
2459	
2460	"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet." "Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.
2461	
2462	"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"
2463	
2464	"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee."
2465	
2466	"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."
2467	
2468	"So I heard. You have him here?"
2469	
2470	"In the cells."
2471	
2472	"Is he quiet?"
2473	
2474	"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."
2475	
2476	"Dirty?"
2477	
2478	"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."
2479	
2480	"I should like to see him very much."
2481	
2482	"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag."
2483	
2484	"No, I think that I'll take it."
2485	
2486	"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.
2487	
2488	"The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.
2489	
2490	"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."
2491	
2492	We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.
2493	
2494	"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.
2495	
2496	"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me." He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.
2497	
2498	"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.
2499	
2500	"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure."
2501	
2502	"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.
2503	
2504	"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent."
2505	
2506	Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
2507	
2508	"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph."
2509	
2510	The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I charged with?"
2511	
2512	"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."
2513	
2514	"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained."
2515	
2516	"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted you wife."
2517	
2518	"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner. "God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"
2519	
2520	Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.
2521	
2522	"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all."
2523	
2524	"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
2525	
2526	"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.
2527	
2528	"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for $25. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.
2529	
2530	"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.
2531	
2532	"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take $2.
2533	
2534	"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.
2535	
2536	"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.
2537	
2538	"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."
2539	
2540	"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.
2541	
2542	"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"
2543	
2544	"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
2545	
2546	"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
2547	
2548	"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
2549	
2550	"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."
2551	
2552	"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
2553	
2554	"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results."
2555	
2556	"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."
2557	
2558	VII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
2559	
2560	
2561	I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.
2562	
2563	"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."
2564	
2565	"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction."
2566	
2567	I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime."
2568	
2569	"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such."
2570	
2571	"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime."
2572	
2573	"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"
2574	
2575	"Yes."
2576	
2577	"It is to him that this trophy belongs."
2578	
2579	"It is his hat."
2580	
2581	"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."
2582	
2583	"Which surely he restored to their owner?"
2584	
2585	"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them."
2586	
2587	"What, then, did Peterson do?"
2588	
2589	"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner."
2590	
2591	"Did he not advertise?"
2592	
2593	"No."
2594	
2595	"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"
2596	
2597	"Only as much as we can deduce."
2598	
2599	"From his hat?"
2600	
2601	"Precisely."
2602	
2603	"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?"
2604	
2605	"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?"
2606	
2607	I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
2608	
2609	"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.
2610	
2611	"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."
2612	
2613	"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"
2614	
2615	He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him."
2616	
2617	"My dear Holmes!"
2618	
2619	"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house."
2620	
2621	"You are certainly joking, Holmes."
2622	
2623	"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"
2624	
2625	"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?"
2626	
2627	For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a brain must have something in it."
2628	
2629	"The decline of his fortunes, then?"
2630	
2631	"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."
2632	
2633	"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?"
2634	
2635	Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. "They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect."
2636	
2637	"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."
2638	
2639	"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training."
2640	
2641	"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."
2642	
2643	"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection."
2644	
2645	"But he might be a bachelor."
2646	
2647	"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."
2648	
2649	"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?"
2650	
2651	"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"
2652	
2653	"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy."
2654	
2655	Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.
2656	
2657	"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.
2658	
2659	"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.
2660	
2661	"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.
2662	
2663	Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?"
2664	
2665	"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty."
2666	
2667	"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."
2668	
2669	"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.
2670	
2671	"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price."
2672	
2673	"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
2674	
2675	"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem."
2676	
2677	"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I remarked.
2678	
2679	"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:
2680	
2681	"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court."
2682	
2683	"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."
2684	
2685	"What will you say?"
2686	
2687	"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."
2688	
2689	"Very. But will he see it?"
2690	
2691	"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers."
2692	
2693	"In which, sir?"
2694	
2695	"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."
2696	
2697	"Very well, sir. And this stone?"
2698	
2699	"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring."
2700	
2701	When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."
2702	
2703	"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"
2704	
2705	"I cannot tell."
2706	
2707	"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?"
2708	
2709	"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement."
2710	
2711	"And you can do nothing until then?"
2712	
2713	"Nothing."
2714	
2715	"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."
2716	
2717	"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."
2718	
2719	I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes' room.
2720	
2721	"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"
2722	
2723	"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."
2724	
2725	He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
2726	
2727	"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes, "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."
2728	
2729	Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them."
2730	
2731	"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."
2732	
2733	"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
2734	
2735	"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?"
2736	
2737	"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.
2738	
2739	"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--"
2740	
2741	The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard."
2742	
2743	Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.
2744	
2745	"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose."
2746	
2747	"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.
2748	
2749	"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"
2750	
2751	"Not particularly."
2752	
2753	"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot."
2754	
2755	"By all means."
2756	
2757	It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
2758	
2759	"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he.
2760	
2761	"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.
2762	
2763	"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club."
2764	
2765	"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."
2766	
2767	"Indeed! Whose, then?"
2768	
2769	"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."
2770	
2771	"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"
2772	
2773	"Breckinridge is his name."
2774	
2775	"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night."
2776	
2777	"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!"
2778	
2779	We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.
2780	
2781	"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.
2782	
2783	The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
2784	
2785	"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.
2786	
2787	"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."
2788	
2789	"That's no good."
2790	
2791	"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."
2792	
2793	"Ah, but I was recommended to you."
2794	
2795	"Who by?"
2796	
2797	"The landlord of the Alpha."
2798	
2799	"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."
2800	
2801	"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"
2802	
2803	To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.
2804	
2805	"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."
2806	
2807	"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha."
2808	
2809	"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"
2810	
2811	"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle."
2812	
2813	"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them."
2814	
2815	"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred."
2816	
2817	"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped the salesman.
2818	
2819	"It's nothing of the kind."
2820	
2821	"I say it is."
2822	
2823	"I don't believe it."
2824	
2825	"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred."
2826	
2827	"You'll never persuade me to believe that."
2828	
2829	"Will you bet, then?"
2830	
2831	"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate."
2832	
2833	The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said he.
2834	
2835	The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.
2836	
2837	"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"
2838	
2839	"Well?"
2840	
2841	"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me."
2842	
2843	"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.
2844	
2845	"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."
2846	
2847	Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.' "
2848	
2849	"Now, then, what's the last entry?"
2850	
2851	" 'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.' "
2852	
2853	"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"
2854	
2855	" 'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.' "
2856	
2857	"What have you to say now?"
2858	
2859	Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.
2860	
2861	"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet," said he. "I daresay that if I had put $100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"
2862	
2863	His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.
2864	
2865	"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?"
2866	
2867	"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little man.
2868	
2869	"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."
2870	
2871	"She told me to ask you."
2872	
2873	"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
2874	
2875	"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes. "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.
2876	
2877	"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering voice.
2878	
2879	"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you."
2880	
2881	"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"
2882	
2883	"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know."
2884	
2885	"But you can know nothing of this?"
2886	
2887	"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member."
2888	
2889	"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."
2890	
2891	Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."
2892	
2893	The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he answered with a sidelong glance.
2894	
2895	"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing business with an alias."
2896	
2897	A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is James Ryder."
2898	
2899	"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know."
2900	
2901	The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.
2902	
2903	"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. "The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?"
2904	
2905	"Yes, sir."
2906	
2907	"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail."
2908	
2909	Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"
2910	
2911	"It came here."
2912	
2913	"Here?"
2914	
2915	"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum."
2916	
2917	Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.
2918	
2919	"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"
2920	
2921	For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.
2922	
2923	"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?"
2924	
2925	"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a crackling voice.
2926	
2927	"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--"
2928	
2929	Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's sake, don't!"
2930	
2931	"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."
2932	
2933	"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down."
2934	
2935	"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety."
2936	
2937	Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.
2938	
2939	"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.
2940	
2941	"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.
2942	
2943	" 'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.
2944	
2945	" 'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.'
2946	
2947	" 'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.'
2948	
2949	" 'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'
2950	
2951	" 'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it expressly for you.'
2952	
2953	" 'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.
2954	
2955	" 'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it you want, then?'
2956	
2957	" 'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.'
2958	
2959	" 'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'
2960	
2961	"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.
2962	
2963	" 'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.
2964	
2965	" 'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'
2966	
2967	" 'Which dealer's?'
2968	
2969	" 'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'
2970	
2971	" 'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same as the one I chose?'
2972	
2973	" 'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.'
2974	
2975	"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.
2976	
2977	There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
2978	
2979	"Get out!" said he.
2980	
2981	"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"
2982	
2983	"No more words. Get out!"
2984	
2985	And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.
2986	
2987	"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature."
2988	
2989	VIII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
2990	
2991	
2992	On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.
2993	
2994	It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
2995	
2996	"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."
2997	
2998	"What is it, then--a fire?"
2999	
3000	"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance."
3001	
3002	"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."
3003	
3004	I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.
3005	
3006	"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."
3007	
3008	"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.
3009	
3010	"What, then?"
3011	
3012	"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.
3013	
3014	"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
3015	
3016	"You know me, then?"
3017	
3018	"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."
3019	
3020	The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.
3021	
3022	"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."
3023	
3024	"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."
3025	
3026	Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.
3027	
3028	"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."
3029	
3030	"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."
3031	
3032	"I am all attention, madam."
3033	
3034	"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."
3035	
3036	Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.
3037	
3038	"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.
3039	
3040	"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not less than $1000 a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
3041	
3042	"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
3043	
3044	"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.
3045	
3046	"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."
3047	
3048	"Your sister is dead, then?"
3049	
3050	"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."
3051	
3052	Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.
3053	
3054	"Pray be precise as to details," said he.
3055	
3056	"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"
3057	
3058	"Perfectly so."
3059	
3060	"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.
3061	
3062	" 'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'
3063	
3064	" 'Never,' said I.
3065	
3066	" 'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'
3067	
3068	" 'Certainly not. But why?'
3069	
3070	" 'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'
3071	
3072	" 'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'
3073	
3074	" 'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'
3075	
3076	" 'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'
3077	
3078	" 'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."
3079	
3080	"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"
3081	
3082	"Always."
3083	
3084	"And why?"
3085	
3086	"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."
3087	
3088	"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."
3089	
3090	"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."
3091	
3092	"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"
3093	
3094	"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."
3095	
3096	"Was your sister dressed?"
3097	
3098	"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."
3099	
3100	"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"
3101	
3102	"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."
3103	
3104	"How about poison?"
3105	
3106	"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."
3107	
3108	"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"
3109	
3110	"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."
3111	
3112	"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"
3113	
3114	"Yes, there are nearly always some there."
3115	
3116	"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"
3117	
3118	"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."
3119	
3120	Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
3121	
3122	"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your narrative."
3123	
3124	"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."
3125	
3126	"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me all?"
3127	
3128	"Yes, all."
3129	
3130	"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."
3131	
3132	"Why, what do you mean?"
3133	
3134	For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.
3135	
3136	"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.
3137	
3138	The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."
3139	
3140	There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
3141	
3142	"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"
3143	
3144	"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."
3145	
3146	"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"
3147	
3148	"By no means."
3149	
3150	"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"
3151	
3152	"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."
3153	
3154	"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?"
3155	
3156	"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.
3157	
3158	"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.
3159	
3160	"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."
3161	
3162	"Dark enough and sinister enough."
3163	
3164	"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."
3165	
3166	"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"
3167	
3168	"I cannot think."
3169	
3170	"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."
3171	
3172	"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
3173	
3174	"I cannot imagine."
3175	
3176	"I see many objections to any such theory."
3177	
3178	"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!"
3179	
3180	The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.
3181	
3182	"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.
3183	
3184	"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my companion quietly.
3185	
3186	"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."
3187	
3188	"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."
3189	
3190	"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"
3191	
3192	"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.
3193	
3194	"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man furiously.
3195	
3196	"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.
3197	
3198	"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."
3199	
3200	My friend smiled.
3201	
3202	"Holmes, the busybody!"
3203	
3204	His smile broadened.
3205	
3206	"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"
3207	
3208	Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."
3209	
3210	"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.
3211	
3212	"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.
3213	
3214	"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.
3215	
3216	"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter."
3217	
3218	It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.
3219	
3220	"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than $750. Each daughter can claim an income of $250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."
3221	
3222	At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.
3223	
3224	"Look there!" said he.
3225	
3226	A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.
3227	
3228	"Stoke Moran?" said he.
3229	
3230	"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked the driver.
3231	
3232	"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is where we are going."
3233	
3234	"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking."
3235	
3236	"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."
3237	
3238	We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.
3239	
3240	"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."
3241	
3242	Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."
3243	
3244	"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
3245	
3246	"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."
3247	
3248	"So it appears."
3249	
3250	"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?"
3251	
3252	"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."
3253	
3254	The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.
3255	
3256	"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"
3257	
3258	"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."
3259	
3260	"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."
3261	
3262	"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."
3263	
3264	"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?"
3265	
3266	"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."
3267	
3268	"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"
3269	
3270	Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."
3271	
3272	A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.
3273	
3274	"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.
3275	
3276	"It goes to the housekeeper's room."
3277	
3278	"It looks newer than the other things?"
3279	
3280	"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."
3281	
3282	"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"
3283	
3284	"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."
3285	
3286	"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
3287	
3288	"Why, it's a dummy," said he.
3289	
3290	"Won't it ring?"
3291	
3292	"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."
3293	
3294	"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."
3295	
3296	"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"
3297	
3298	"That is also quite modern," said the lady.
3299	
3300	"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.
3301	
3302	"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."
3303	
3304	"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."
3305	
3306	Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.
3307	
3308	"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.
3309	
3310	"My stepfather's business papers."
3311	
3312	"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"
3313	
3314	"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers."
3315	
3316	"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"
3317	
3318	"No. What a strange idea!"
3319	
3320	"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.
3321	
3322	"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."
3323	
3324	"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.
3325	
3326	"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"
3327	
3328	The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
3329	
3330	"What do you make of that, Watson?"
3331	
3332	"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be tied."
3333	
3334	"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."
3335	
3336	I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.
3337	
3338	"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."
3339	
3340	"I shall most certainly do so."
3341	
3342	"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance."
3343	
3344	"I assure you that I am in your hands."
3345	
3346	"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."
3347	
3348	Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
3349	
3350	"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?"
3351	
3352	"Yes, that is the Crown."
3353	
3354	"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"
3355	
3356	"Certainly."
3357	
3358	"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."
3359	
3360	"Oh, yes, easily."
3361	
3362	"The rest you will leave in our hands."
3363	
3364	"But what will you do?"
3365	
3366	"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."
3367	
3368	"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.
3369	
3370	"Perhaps I have."
3371	
3372	"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."
3373	
3374	"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."
3375	
3376	"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."
3377	
3378	"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."
3379	
3380	Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
3381	
3382	"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."
3383	
3384	"Can I be of assistance?"
3385	
3386	"Your presence might be invaluable."
3387	
3388	"Then I shall certainly come."
3389	
3390	"It is very kind of you."
3391	
3392	"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."
3393	
3394	"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did."
3395	
3396	"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."
3397	
3398	"You saw the ventilator, too?"
3399	
3400	"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."
3401	
3402	"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."
3403	
3404	"My dear Holmes!"
3405	
3406	"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."
3407	
3408	"But what harm can there be in that?"
3409	
3410	"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?"
3411	
3412	"I cannot as yet see any connection."
3413	
3414	"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"
3415	
3416	"No."
3417	
3418	"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"
3419	
3420	"I cannot say that I have."
3421	
3422	"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."
3423	
3424	"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."
3425	
3426	"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."
3427	
3428	About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
3429	
3430	"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from the middle window."
3431	
3432	As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.
3433	
3434	There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
3435	
3436	"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"
3437	
3438	Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.
3439	
3440	"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."
3441	
3442	I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:
3443	
3444	"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."
3445	
3446	I nodded to show that I had heard.
3447	
3448	"We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator."
3449	
3450	I nodded again.
3451	
3452	"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."
3453	
3454	I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
3455	
3456	Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.
3457	
3458	How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
3459	
3460	From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.
3461	
3462	Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.
3463	
3464	"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"
3465	
3466	But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.
3467	
3468	"What can it mean?" I gasped.
3469	
3470	"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room."
3471	
3472	With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
3473	
3474	It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
3475	
3476	"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.
3477	
3478	I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
3479	
3480	"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."
3481	
3482	As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.
3483	
3484	Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.
3485	
3486	"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.
3487	
3488	"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."
3489	
3490	"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."
3491	
3492	"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."

3494	IX.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
3495	
3496	
3497	Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.
3498	
3499	It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.
3500	
3501	One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.
3502	
3503	"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all right."
3504	
3505	"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
3506	
3507	"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.
3508	
3509	I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.
3510	
3511	"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table."
3512	
3513	I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."
3514	
3515	"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.
3516	
3517	"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out some water from a caraffe.
3518	
3519	It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.
3520	
3521	"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
3522	
3523	"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
3524	
3525	"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be."
3526	
3527	He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
3528	
3529	"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably."
3530	
3531	"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."
3532	
3533	"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."
3534	
3535	"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province."
3536	
3537	"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very heavy and sharp instrument."
3538	
3539	"A thing like a cleaver," said he.
3540	
3541	"An accident, I presume?"
3542	
3543	"By no means."
3544	
3545	"What! a murderous attack?"
3546	
3547	"Very murderous indeed."
3548	
3549	"You horrify me."
3550	
3551	I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
3552	
3553	"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.
3554	
3555	"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."
3556	
3557	"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves."
3558	
3559	"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."
3560	
3561	"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police."
3562	
3563	"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?"
3564	
3565	"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."
3566	
3567	"I should be immensely obliged to you."
3568	
3569	"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"
3570	
3571	"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."
3572	
3573	"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.
3574	
3575	Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.
3576	
3577	"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."
3578	
3579	"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences."
3580	
3581	Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.
3582	
3583	"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.
3584	
3585	"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to $27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.
3586	
3587	"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.
3588	
3589	" 'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent. 'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.'
3590	
3591	"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'
3592	
3593	" 'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'
3594	
3595	" 'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?'
3596	
3597	" 'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'
3598	
3599	" 'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.'
3600	
3601	"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
3602	
3603	" 'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.
3604	
3605	" 'Yes, I promise.'
3606	
3607	" 'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'
3608	
3609	" 'I have already given you my word.'
3610	
3611	" 'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.
3612	
3613	" 'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
3614	
3615	"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.
3616	
3617	" 'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.
3618	
3619	" 'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.
3620	
3621	" 'Most admirably.'
3622	
3623	" 'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?'
3624	
3625	" 'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'
3626	
3627	" 'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.'
3628	
3629	" 'Where to?'
3630	
3631	" 'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.'
3632	
3633	" 'Very good.'
3634	
3635	" 'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'
3636	
3637	" 'There is a drive, then?'
3638	
3639	" 'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'
3640	
3641	" 'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.'
3642	
3643	" 'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'
3644	
3645	" 'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?'
3646	
3647	" 'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.'
3648	
3649	"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.'
3650	
3651	" 'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?'
3652	
3653	" 'Entirely.'
3654	
3655	" 'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?'
3656	
3657	" 'I have heard so.'
3658	
3659	" 'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'
3660	
3661	" 'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.'
3662	
3663	" 'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.'
3664	
3665	" 'I shall certainly be there.'
3666	
3667	" 'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.
3668	
3669	"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
3670	
3671	"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."
3672	
3673	"One horse?" interjected Holmes.
3674	
3675	"Yes, only one."
3676	
3677	"Did you observe the colour?"
3678	
3679	"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut."
3680	
3681	"Tired-looking or fresh?"
3682	
3683	"Oh, fresh and glossy."
3684	
3685	"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement."
3686	
3687	"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.
3688	
3689	"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.
3690	
3691	" 'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and vanished into the darkness.
3692	
3693	"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.
3694	
3695	"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.
3696	
3697	" 'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.'
3698	
3699	" 'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'
3700	
3701	" 'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too late!'
3702	
3703	"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.
3704	
3705	"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
3706	
3707	" 'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'
3708	
3709	" 'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.'
3710	
3711	"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.'
3712	
3713	" 'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'
3714	
3715	" 'Oh, no, it is in the house.'
3716	
3717	" 'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'
3718	
3719	" 'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.'
3720	
3721	"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.
3722	
3723	"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.
3724	
3725	" 'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.'
3726	
3727	"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.
3728	
3729	" 'What are you doing there?' he asked.
3730	
3731	"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,' said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.'
3732	
3733	"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.
3734	
3735	" 'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'
3736	
3737	"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.
3738	
3739	"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.
3740	
3741	"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.
3742	
3743	" 'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'
3744	
3745	"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.
3746	
3747	" 'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.'
3748	
3749	"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
3750	
3751	" 'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!'
3752	
3753	" 'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.
3754	
3755	"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.
3756	
3757	"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
3758	
3759	"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.
3760	
3761	"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise."
3762	
3763	We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.
3764	
3765	"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: 'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."
3766	
3767	"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the girl said."
3768	
3769	"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford."
3770	
3771	Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.
3772	
3773	"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
3774	
3775	"It was an hour's good drive."
3776	
3777	"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?"
3778	
3779	"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere."
3780	
3781	"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."
3782	
3783	"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life."
3784	
3785	"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
3786	
3787	"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
3788	
3789	"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there."
3790	
3791	"And I say east," said my patient.
3792	
3793	"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are several quiet little villages up there."
3794	
3795	"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any."
3796	
3797	"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?"
3798	
3799	"You are all wrong."
3800	
3801	"But we can't all be."
3802	
3803	"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."
3804	
3805	"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.
3806	
3807	"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"
3808	
3809	"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang."
3810	
3811	"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver."
3812	
3813	"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work," said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."
3814	
3815	But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.
3816	
3817	"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.
3818	
3819	"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.
3820	
3821	"When did it break out?"
3822	
3823	"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze."
3824	
3825	"Whose house is it?"
3826	
3827	"Dr. Becher's."
3828	
3829	"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"
3830	
3831	The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."
3832	
3833	The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.
3834	
3835	"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from."
3836	
3837	"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now."
3838	
3839	And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.
3840	
3841	The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.
3842	
3843	How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.
3844	
3845	"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?"
3846	
3847	"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence."
3848	
3849	X.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
3850	
3851	
3852	The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.
3853	
3854	It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.
3855	
3856	"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered. "Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter."
3857	
3858	"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."
3859	
3860	He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
3861	
3862	"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."
3863	
3864	"Not social, then?"
3865	
3866	"No, distinctly professional."
3867	
3868	"And from a noble client?"
3869	
3870	"One of the highest in England."
3871	
3872	"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."
3873	
3874	"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?"
3875	
3876	"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."
3877	
3878	"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?"
3879	
3880	"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."
3881	
3882	"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:
3883	
3884	" 'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,
3885	
3886	
3887	" 'ST. SIMON.'
3888	
3889	"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.
3890	
3891	"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour."
3892	
3893	"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. " 'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.' He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid."
3894	
3895	"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I, "for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters."
3896	
3897	"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections."
3898	
3899	"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."
3900	
3901	"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.
3902	
3903	"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.' "
3904	
3905	"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.
3906	
3907	"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."
3908	
3909	"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.
3910	
3911	"The vanishing of the lady."
3912	
3913	"When did she vanish, then?"
3914	
3915	"At the wedding breakfast."
3916	
3917	"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact."
3918	
3919	"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."
3920	
3921	"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details."
3922	
3923	"I warn you that they are very incomplete."
3924	
3925	"Perhaps we may make them less so."
3926	
3927	"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
3928	
3929	" 'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.
3930	
3931	" 'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.' "
3932	
3933	"And is that all?"
3934	
3935	"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one."
3936	
3937	"And it is--"
3938	
3939	"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press."
3940	
3941	"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory."
3942	
3943	"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.
3944	
3945	"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over."
3946	
3947	"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society."
3948	
3949	"No, I am descending."
3950	
3951	"I beg pardon."
3952	
3953	"My last client of the sort was a king."
3954	
3955	"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"
3956	
3957	"The King of Scandinavia."
3958	
3959	"What! Had he lost his wife?"
3960	
3961	"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours."
3962	
3963	"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion."
3964	
3965	"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."
3966	
3967	Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes."
3968	
3969	"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you."
3970	
3971	"Pray do so."
3972	
3973	"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"
3974	
3975	"In San Francisco, a year ago."
3976	
3977	"You were travelling in the States?"
3978	
3979	"Yes."
3980	
3981	"Did you become engaged then?"
3982	
3983	"No."
3984	
3985	"But you were on a friendly footing?"
3986	
3987	"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused."
3988	
3989	"Her father is very rich?"
3990	
3991	"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."
3992	
3993	"And how did he make his money?"
3994	
3995	"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."
3996	
3997	"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your wife's character?"
3998	
3999	The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."
4000	
4001	"Have you her photograph?"
4002	
4003	"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
4004	
4005	"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?"
4006	
4007	"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her."
4008	
4009	"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"
4010	
4011	"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."
4012	
4013	"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?"
4014	
4015	"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."
4016	
4017	"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?"
4018	
4019	"Yes."
4020	
4021	"Was she in good spirits?"
4022	
4023	"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives."
4024	
4025	"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?"
4026	
4027	"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony."
4028	
4029	"And did you observe any change in her then?"
4030	
4031	"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case."
4032	
4033	"Pray let us have it, for all that."
4034	
4035	"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."
4036	
4037	"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?"
4038	
4039	"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open."
4040	
4041	"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"
4042	
4043	"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."
4044	
4045	"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father's house?"
4046	
4047	"I saw her in conversation with her maid."
4048	
4049	"And who is her maid?"
4050	
4051	"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her."
4052	
4053	"A confidential servant?"
4054	
4055	"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way."
4056	
4057	"How long did she speak to this Alice?"
4058	
4059	"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."
4060	
4061	"You did not overhear what they said?"
4062	
4063	"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant."
4064	
4065	"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"
4066	
4067	"She walked into the breakfast-room."
4068	
4069	"On your arm?"
4070	
4071	"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back."
4072	
4073	"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out."
4074	
4075	"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning."
4076	
4077	"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her."
4078	
4079	Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row."
4080	
4081	"Did your wife hear all this?"
4082	
4083	"No, thank goodness, she did not."
4084	
4085	"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"
4086	
4087	"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her."
4088	
4089	"Well, it is a possible supposition."
4090	
4091	"You think so, too?"
4092	
4093	"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"
4094	
4095	"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."
4096	
4097	"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?"
4098	
4099	"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."
4100	
4101	"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"
4102	
4103	"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
4104	
4105	"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
4106	
4107	"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
4108	
4109	"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you."
4110	
4111	"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our client, rising.
4112	
4113	"I have solved it."
4114	
4115	"Eh? What was that?"
4116	
4117	"I say that I have solved it."
4118	
4119	"Where, then, is my wife?"
4120	
4121	"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
4122	
4123	Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
4124	
4125	"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room."
4126	
4127	"My dear Holmes!"
4128	
4129	"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
4130	
4131	"But I have heard all that you have heard."
4132	
4133	"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box."
4134	
4135	The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
4136	
4137	"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied."
4138	
4139	"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."
4140	
4141	"Really! You surprise me."
4142	
4143	"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."
4144	
4145	"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
4146	
4147	"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."
4148	
4149	"In heaven's name, what for?"
4150	
4151	"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."
4152	
4153	Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
4154	
4155	"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he asked.
4156	
4157	"Why? What do you mean?"
4158	
4159	"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other."
4160	
4161	Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you know all about it," he snarled.
4162	
4163	"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."
4164	
4165	"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?"
4166	
4167	"I think it very unlikely."
4168	
4169	"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."
4170	
4171	"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. "You dragged them from the Serpentine?"
4172	
4173	"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."
4174	
4175	"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"
4176	
4177	"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."
4178	
4179	"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."
4180	
4181	"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."
4182	
4183	"And how?"
4184	
4185	"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."
4186	
4187	"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said he.
4188	
4189	"Ha! you find it so?"
4190	
4191	"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."
4192	
4193	Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"
4194	
4195	"On the contrary, this is the right side."
4196	
4197	"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here."
4198	
4199	"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply."
4200	
4201	"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade. " 'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."
4202	
4203	"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again."
4204	
4205	"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.
4206	
4207	"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person."
4208	
4209	Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
4210	
4211	He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little."
4212	
4213	It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.
4214	
4215	Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.
4216	
4217	"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.
4218	
4219	"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."
4220	
4221	"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."
4222	
4223	It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
4224	
4225	"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.
4226	
4227	"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?"
4228	
4229	"The best possible."
4230	
4231	Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.
4232	
4233	"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"
4234	
4235	"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation."
4236	
4237	"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."
4238	
4239	"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis."
4240	
4241	"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.
4242	
4243	"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."
4244	
4245	"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used."
4246	
4247	"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met."
4248	
4249	At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.
4250	
4251	"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every cause to be."
4252	
4253	"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
4254	
4255	"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."
4256	
4257	"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?"
4258	
4259	"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
4260	
4261	"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.
4262	
4263	"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
4264	
4265	"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.
4266	
4267	"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding."
4268	
4269	"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived."
4270	
4271	"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me."
4272	
4273	Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.
4274	
4275	"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner."
4276	
4277	"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"
4278	
4279	"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
4280	
4281	"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."
4282	
4283	"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
4284	
4285	"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."
4286	
4287	"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard."
4288	
4289	"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"
4290	
4291	"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."
4292	
4293	"And how in the world did you find them?"
4294	
4295	"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."
4296	
4297	"How did you deduce the select?"
4298	
4299	"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment."
4300	
4301	"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was certainly not very gracious."
4302	
4303	"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings."
4304	
4305	XI.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
4306	
4307	
4308	"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."
4309	
4310	My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
4311	
4312	He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.
4313	
4314	"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the houses."
4315	
4316	"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his hands.
4317	
4318	"Here?"
4319	
4320	"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.
4321	
4322	A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
4323	
4324	"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he. "You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me."
4325	
4326	The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
4327	
4328	"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.
4329	
4330	"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.
4331	
4332	"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair."
4333	
4334	"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you."
4335	
4336	"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."
4337	
4338	The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.
4339	
4340	"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
4341	
4342	"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.
4343	
4344	"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.
4345	
4346	" 'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.'
4347	
4348	" 'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.
4349	
4350	" 'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have $50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'
4351	
4352	" 'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.
4353	
4354	" 'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.'
4355	
4356	" 'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.'
4357	
4358	" 'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. 'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'
4359	
4360	" 'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,' said I.
4361	
4362	" 'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.'
4363	
4364	"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.
4365	
4366	" 'You doubt its value?' he asked.
4367	
4368	" 'Not at all. I only doubt--'
4369	
4370	" 'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'
4371	
4372	" 'Ample.'
4373	
4374	" 'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.'
4375	
4376	"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty $1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.
4377	
4378	"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.
4379	
4380	"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
4381	
4382	"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.
4383	
4384	"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.
4385	
4386	"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.
4387	
4388	"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!
4389	
4390	"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.
4391	
4392	"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.
4393	
4394	" 'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.
4395	
4396	" 'In my own bureau.'
4397	
4398	" 'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.' said he.
4399	
4400	" 'It is locked up,' I answered.
4401	
4402	" 'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'
4403	
4404	"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.
4405	
4406	" 'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let me have $200?'
4407	
4408	" 'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too generous with you in money matters.'
4409	
4410	" 'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'
4411	
4412	" 'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.
4413	
4414	" 'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,' said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.'
4415	
4416	"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.
4417	
4418	"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.
4419	
4420	" 'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?'
4421	
4422	" 'Certainly not.'
4423	
4424	" 'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'
4425	
4426	" 'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'
4427	
4428	" 'Quite sure, dad.'
4429	
4430	" 'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.
4431	
4432	"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear."
4433	
4434	"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."
4435	
4436	"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.
4437	
4438	" 'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'
4439	
4440	"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.
4441	
4442	" 'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'
4443	
4444	" 'Stolen!' he cried.
4445	
4446	" 'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
4447	
4448	" 'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.
4449	
4450	" 'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?'
4451	
4452	" 'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.'
4453	
4454	" 'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.'
4455	
4456	" 'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.'
4457	
4458	"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.
4459	
4460	" 'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.'
4461	
4462	" 'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.
4463	
4464	" 'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'
4465	
4466	" 'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of $1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"
4467	
4468	He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.
4469	
4470	Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
4471	
4472	"Do you receive much company?" he asked.
4473	
4474	"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think."
4475	
4476	"Do you go out much in society?"
4477	
4478	"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it."
4479	
4480	"That is unusual in a young girl."
4481	
4482	"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty."
4483	
4484	"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also."
4485	
4486	"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."
4487	
4488	"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"
4489	
4490	"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands."
4491	
4492	"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?"
4493	
4494	"Yes, it was twisted."
4495	
4496	"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?"
4497	
4498	"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"
4499	
4500	"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?"
4501	
4502	"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door."
4503	
4504	"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?"
4505	
4506	"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them."
4507	
4508	"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"
4509	
4510	"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined."
4511	
4512	"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"
4513	
4514	"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?"
4515	
4516	"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."
4517	
4518	My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.
4519	
4520	Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.
4521	
4522	"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?" she asked.
4523	
4524	"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."
4525	
4526	"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly."
4527	
4528	"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"
4529	
4530	"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him."
4531	
4532	"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?"
4533	
4534	"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!"
4535	
4536	"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it."
4537	
4538	"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.
4539	
4540	"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now."
4541	
4542	"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."
4543	
4544	"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"
4545	
4546	"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."
4547	
4548	"You heard nothing yourself last night?"
4549	
4550	"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down."
4551	
4552	"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?"
4553	
4554	"Yes."
4555	
4556	"Were they all fastened this morning?"
4557	
4558	"Yes."
4559	
4560	"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"
4561	
4562	"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."
4563	
4564	"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."
4565	
4566	"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?"
4567	
4568	"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?"
4569	
4570	"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."
4571	
4572	"Do you know him?"
4573	
4574	"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper."
4575	
4576	"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"
4577	
4578	"Yes, he did."
4579	
4580	"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"
4581	
4582	Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin, eager face.
4583	
4584	"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."
4585	
4586	He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs," said he at last.
4587	
4588	The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
4589	
4590	"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.
4591	
4592	"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room."
4593	
4594	"Have you it here?"
4595	
4596	"That is it on the dressing-table."
4597	
4598	Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
4599	
4600	"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.
4601	
4602	"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."
4603	
4604	The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying," said he.
4605	
4606	"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"
4607	
4608	"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."
4609	
4610	"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?"
4611	
4612	"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."
4613	
4614	"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"
4615	
4616	"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."
4617	
4618	"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside."
4619	
4620	He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
4621	
4622	"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my rooms."
4623	
4624	"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"
4625	
4626	"I cannot tell."
4627	
4628	The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"
4629	
4630	"My opinion is in no way altered."
4631	
4632	"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?"
4633	
4634	"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw."
4635	
4636	"I would give my fortune to have them back."
4637	
4638	"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening."
4639	
4640	It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.
4641	
4642	"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.
4643	
4644	I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.
4645	
4646	"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."
4647	
4648	"Where to?"
4649	
4650	"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be late."
4651	
4652	"How are you getting on?"
4653	
4654	"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self."
4655	
4656	I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.
4657	
4658	I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.
4659	
4660	"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning."
4661	
4662	"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."
4663	
4664	It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.
4665	
4666	"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me."
4667	
4668	"Deserted you?"
4669	
4670	"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:
4671	
4672	" 'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving
4673	
4674	
4675	" 'MARY.'
4676	
4677	"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?"
4678	
4679	"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles."
4680	
4681	"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?"
4682	
4683	"You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?"
4684	
4685	"I would pay ten."
4686	
4687	"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for $4000."
4688	
4689	With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
4690	
4691	With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
4692	
4693	"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"
4694	
4695	The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
4696	
4697	"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.
4698	
4699	"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."
4700	
4701	"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one."
4702	
4703	"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"
4704	
4705	"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."
4706	
4707	"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known."
4708	
4709	"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips."
4710	
4711	"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!"
4712	
4713	"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together."
4714	
4715	"My Mary? Impossible!"
4716	
4717	"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening."
4718	
4719	"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.
4720	
4721	"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.
4722	
4723	"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
4724	
4725	"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene."
4726	
4727	"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.
4728	
4729	"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret."
4730	
4731	"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"
4732	
4733	"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.
4734	
4735	"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.
4736	
4737	"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?
4738	
4739	"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.
4740	
4741	"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.
4742	
4743	"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."
4744	
4745	"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said Mr. Holder.
4746	
4747	"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--$1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why, dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at $1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work."
4748	
4749	"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
4750	
4751	"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment."
4752	
4753	XII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
4754	
4755	
4756	"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province."
4757	
4758	"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records."
4759	
4760	"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing."
4761	
4762	"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter," I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.
4763	
4764	"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales."
4765	
4766	It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
4767	
4768	"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."
4769	
4770	"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest."
4771	
4772	"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.
4773	
4774	It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:
4775	
4776	"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
4777	
4778	
4779	"VIOLET HUNTER."
4780	
4781	"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.
4782	
4783	"Not I."
4784	
4785	"It is half-past ten now."
4786	
4787	"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."
4788	
4789	"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also."
4790	
4791	"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."
4792	
4793	As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.
4794	
4795	"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do."
4796	
4797	"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you."
4798	
4799	I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.
4800	
4801	"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.
4802	
4803	"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.
4804	
4805	"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.
4806	
4807	" 'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.
4808	
4809	" 'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.
4810	
4811	" 'Yes, sir.'
4812	
4813	" 'As governess?'
4814	
4815	" 'Yes, sir.'
4816	
4817	" 'And what salary do you ask?'
4818	
4819	" 'I had $4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.'
4820	
4821	" 'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?'
4822	
4823	" 'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'
4824	
4825	" 'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at $100 a year.'
4826	
4827	"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
4828	
4829	" 'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'
4830	
4831	"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.
4832	
4833	" 'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.
4834	
4835	" 'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'
4836	
4837	" 'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.'
4838	
4839	" 'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.
4840	
4841	"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.
4842	
4843	" 'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single child?'
4844	
4845	" 'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'
4846	
4847	" 'I should be happy to make myself useful.'
4848	
4849	" 'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?'
4850	
4851	" 'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.
4852	
4853	" 'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?'
4854	
4855	" 'Oh, no.'
4856	
4857	" 'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'
4858	
4859	"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.
4860	
4861	" 'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.
4862	
4863	" 'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your hair?'
4864	
4865	" 'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.
4866	
4867	" 'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.'
4868	
4869	"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.
4870	
4871	" 'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.
4872	
4873	" 'If you please, Miss Stoper.'
4874	
4875	" 'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.
4876	
4877	"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:
4878	
4879	
4880	" 'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
4881	
4882	" 'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give $30 a quarter, or $120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,
4883	
4884	
4885	" 'JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'
4886	
4887	"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration."
4888	
4889	"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question," said Holmes, smiling.
4890	
4891	"But you would not advise me to refuse?"
4892	
4893	"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for."
4894	
4895	"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"
4896	
4897	"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"
4898	
4899	"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?"
4900	
4901	"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."
4902	
4903	"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"
4904	
4905	"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you $120 a year, when they could have their pick for $40? There must be some strong reason behind."
4906	
4907	"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
4908	
4909	"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--"
4910	
4911	"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"
4912	
4913	Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."
4914	
4915	"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.
4916	
4917	"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."
4918	
4919	"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."
4920	
4921	It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.
4922	
4923	The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
4924	
4925	"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.
4926	
4927	The summons was a brief and urgent one.
4928	
4929	"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.
4930	
4931	
4932	"HUNTER."
4933	
4934	"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.
4935	
4936	"I should wish to."
4937	
4938	"Just look it up, then."
4939	
4940	"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."
4941	
4942	"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning."
4943	
4944	By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.
4945	
4946	"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
4947	
4948	But Holmes shook his head gravely.
4949	
4950	"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there."
4951	
4952	"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"
4953	
4954	"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."
4955	
4956	"You horrify me!"
4957	
4958	"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened."
4959	
4960	"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."
4961	
4962	"Quite so. She has her freedom."
4963	
4964	"What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"
4965	
4966	"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell."
4967	
4968	The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.
4969	
4970	"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."
4971	
4972	"Pray tell us what has happened to you."
4973	
4974	"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."
4975	
4976	"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
4977	
4978	"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them."
4979	
4980	"What can you not understand?"
4981	
4982	"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
4983	
4984	"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.
4985	
4986	"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story."
4987	
4988	"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they seem to you to be relevant or not."
4989	
4990	"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.
4991	
4992	"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.
4993	
4994	" 'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.'
4995	
4996	"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.
4997	
4998	"Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.
4999	
5000	"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.
5001	
5002	" 'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'
5003	
5004	" 'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.
5005	
5006	" 'No, I know no one in these parts.'
5007	
5008	" 'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.'
5009	
5010	" 'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'
5011	
5012	" 'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.'
5013	
5014	"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road."
5015	
5016	"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one."
5017	
5018	"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.
5019	
5020	" 'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'
5021	
5022	"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.
5023	
5024	" 'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life is worth.'
5025	
5026	"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.
5027	
5028	"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.
5029	
5030	"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.
5031	
5032	"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.
5033	
5034	"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.
5035	
5036	" 'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.'
5037	
5038	"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I, 'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.'
5039	
5040	"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.
5041	
5042	" 'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.
5043	
5044	"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.
5045	
5046	"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.
5047	
5048	"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.
5049	
5050	" 'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.'
5051	
5052	" 'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.
5053	
5054	" 'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?'
5055	
5056	"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.
5057	
5058	" 'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered. 'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!'
5059	
5060	" 'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.
5061	
5062	" 'Why, what did you think?' I asked.
5063	
5064	" 'Why do you think that I lock this door?'
5065	
5066	" 'I am sure that I do not know.'
5067	
5068	" 'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
5069	
5070	" 'I am sure if I had known--'
5071	
5072	" 'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'
5073	
5074	"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do."
5075	
5076	Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.
5077	
5078	"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.
5079	
5080	"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him."
5081	
5082	"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"
5083	
5084	"Yes."
5085	
5086	"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"
5087	
5088	"Yes, the wine-cellar."
5089	
5090	"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman."
5091	
5092	"I will try. What is it?"
5093	
5094	"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely."
5095	
5096	"I will do it."
5097	
5098	"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and no doubt, as you wore the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child."
5099	
5100	"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.
5101	
5102	"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power."
5103	
5104	"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature."
5105	
5106	"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery."
5107	
5108	We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.
5109	
5110	"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.
5111	
5112	A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's."
5113	
5114	"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business."
5115	
5116	We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes' face clouded over.
5117	
5118	"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in."
5119	
5120	It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.
5121	
5122	"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim off."
5123	
5124	"But how?"
5125	
5126	"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it."
5127	
5128	"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away."
5129	
5130	"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."
5131	
5132	The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.
5133	
5134	"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"
5135	
5136	The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.
5137	
5138	"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.
5139	
5140	"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.
5141	
5142	"I have my revolver," said I.
5143	
5144	"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.
5145	
5146	"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"
5147	
5148	Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
5149	
5150	"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.
5151	
5152	"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted."
5153	
5154	"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."
5155	
5156	"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."
5157	
5158	"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."
5159	
5160	"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.
5161	
5162	"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."
5163	
5164	"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?"
5165	
5166	"Yes, sir."
5167	
5168	"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."
5169	
5170	"That was it, sir."
5171	
5172	"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his."
5173	
5174	"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said Mrs. Toller serenely.
5175	
5176	"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out."
5177	
5178	"You have it, sir, just as it happened."
5179	
5180	"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one."
5181	
5182	And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

5190	Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
5191	editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
5192	unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
5193	keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
5194	
5195	We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
5196	of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
5197	Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
5198	even years after the official publication date.

5200	Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
5201	midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
5202	The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
5203	Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
5204	preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
5205	and editing by those who wish to do so.

5232	
5233	We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
5234	time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
5235	to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
5236	searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
5237	projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
5238	per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
5239	million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
5240	files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
5241	We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
5242	If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
5243	will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.
5244	
5245	The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
5246	This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
5247	which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

5365	ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
5366	This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
5367	is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
5368	through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
5369	Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
5370	on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and

5378	
5379	To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
5380	efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
5381	works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
5382	medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
5383	things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
5384	corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
5385	intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
5386	disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
5387	codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

5402	you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
5403	time to the person you received it from. If you received it

5581	PREFACE
5582	
5583	
5584	As things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in
5585	our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.
5586	Three separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which
5587	is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
5588	anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth
5589	grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the
5590	addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high
5591	school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving
5592	fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we
5593	do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their
5594	study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the
5595	same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the
5596	multiplication table and fractions.
5597	
5598	There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It
5599	is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history
5600	their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of
5601	history will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing
5602	methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be
5603	made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and
5604	languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding
5605	their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive
5606	historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more
5607	facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp
5608	criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and
5609	economics.
5610	
5611	In this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a
5612	new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one
5613	of omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the
5614	biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know
5615	little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John
5616	Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the
5617	same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It
5618	is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are
5619	demonstrated to be progressive in character.
5620	
5621	In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our
5622	reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single
5623	battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter
5624	about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval
5625	operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To
5626	dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is
5627	equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who
5628	compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign
5629	with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further
5630	comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think
5631	of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of
5632	warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the
5633	interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that
5634	deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's
5635	serious responsibilities.
5636	
5637	It is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is
5638	rather upon constructive features.
5639	
5640	_First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have
5641	tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of
5642	each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.
5643	
5644	_Second._ We have emphasized those historical topics which help to
5645	explain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.
5646	
5647	_Third._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
5648	history, especially in relation to the politics of each period.
5649	
5650	_Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems
5651	of financing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.
5652	These are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. These
5653	are matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must
5654	understand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.
5655	
5656	_Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to
5657	enlarge the treatment of our own time. We have given special attention
5658	to the history of those current questions which must form the subject
5659	matter of sound instruction in citizenship.
5660	
5661	_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique
5662	characteristics, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we
5663	have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the
5664	reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.
5665	
5666	_Seventh._ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The
5667	study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We
5668	have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,
5669	reflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as
5670	inform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,
5671	simple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the
5672	intellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them
5673	will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school.
5674	The world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will
5675	depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. The
5676	effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by
5677	the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their
5678	information.

5997	THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA
5998	
5999	
6000	The tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America
6001	during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in
6002	the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the
6003	earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,
6004	westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into
6005	Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported
6006	by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the
6007	narrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to
6008	the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the
6009	Danube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the
6010	beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires
6011	the settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only
6012	one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the
6013	institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.
6014	
6015	In one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed
6016	from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them
6017	affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the
6018	altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to
6019	America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother
6020	country. They established compacts of government for themselves and set
6021	up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also
6022	political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.
6023	
6024	
6025	THE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION
6026	
6027	It was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of
6028	water and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the
6029	seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays
6030	of money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain
6031	the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.
6032	Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk
6033	the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and
6034	mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,
6035	adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an
6036	enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or
6037	gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to
6038	assume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy
6039	proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was
6040	the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the
6041	beginning.
6042	
6043	=The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration found an
6044	instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which
6045	had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.
6046	Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of
6047	society--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a
6048	particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in
6049	the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it
6050	received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from
6051	the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and
6052	control. The charter named all the persons originally included in the
6053	corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its
6054	affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in
6055	fact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the
6056	corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,
6057	they operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the
6058	seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,
6059	they became the direct government of the country they possessed. The
6060	stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the
6061	chief magistrate.
6062	
6063	[Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY
6064	COMPANY]
6065	
6066	Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the
6067	trading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King James I,
6068	in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia
6069	at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,
6070	chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New
6071	Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts
6072	were Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated
6073	in 1629 under the title: "The governor and company of the Massachusetts
6074	Bay in New England." In this case the law did but incorporate a group
6075	drawn together by religious ties. "We must be knit together as one man,"
6076	wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the
6077	south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company
6078	in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it
6079	was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the
6080	rule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.
6081	
6082	In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the "company
6083	colonies." It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,
6084	James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned
6085	for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George
6086	II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including
6087	himself, into "one body politic and corporate," known as the "Trustees
6088	for establishing the colony of Georgia in America." In the structure of
6089	their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not
6090	differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and
6091	colonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions
6092	had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.
6093	
6094	=The Religious Congregation.=--A second agency which figured largely in
6095	the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or
6096	congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common
6097	religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this
6098	institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a
6099	potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far
6100	away from Galilee. "And the multitude of them that believed were of one
6101	heart and of one soul," we are told in the Acts describing the Church at
6102	Jerusalem. "We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of
6103	the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all
6104	care of each other's good and of the whole," wrote John Robinson, a
6105	leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in
6106	1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a
6107	written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to
6108	the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until
6109	Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.
6110	
6111	[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]
6112	
6113	Three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve
6114	of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the
6115	congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New
6116	Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by
6117	small bodies of men and women, "united in solemn covenants with the
6118	Lord," who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a
6119	year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers
6120	to the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of
6121	incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation
6122	of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River
6123	Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own
6124	(1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the
6125	towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts
6126	were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.
6127	
6128	Even when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of
6129	the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government
6130	and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The
6131	towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily
6132	under their "Fundamental Orders" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had
6133	the settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their "Fundamental
6134	Articles" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut
6135	shore had no difficulty in agreeing that "the Scriptures do hold forth a
6136	perfect rule for the direction and government of all men."
6137	
6138	=The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the
6139	proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word
6140	"property," implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king
6141	granted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy
6142	for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down
6143	to his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and
6144	powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the
6145	ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found
6146	and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor
6147	worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the
6148	common undertaking.
6149	
6150	Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,
6151	owe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor
6152	in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,
6153	established in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and
6154	blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under
6155	the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American
6156	union. New Jersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, Berkeley
6157	and Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown
6158	in 1702. Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the
6159	generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader
6160	of the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in
6161	whose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first
6162	organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of
6163	eight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a
6164	century both became royal provinces governed by the king.

6169	THE COLONIAL PEOPLES
6170	
6171	=The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except
6172	New York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save
6173	these two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from
6174	England. The colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,
6175	women, and children of "all sorts and conditions." The major portion
6176	were yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With
6177	them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or
6178	their fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and
6179	Cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an
6180	English nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with
6181	America. The people represented every religious faith--members of the
6182	Established Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that
6183	church; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;
6184	and Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.
6185	
6186	New England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and
6187	1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand
6188	Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far
6189	North. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater
6190	portion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.
6191	Virginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from
6192	England alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other
6193	nationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in
6194	numbers.
6195	
6196	The populations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,
6197	Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of
6198	immigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from
6199	the older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England
6200	in such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that
6201	"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church." North Carolina was
6202	first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.
6203	Some of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the
6204	way from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how
6205	little they were wanted in that Anglican colony.
6206	
6207	=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were
6208	the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both
6209	religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch
6210	ancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland
6211	whence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There
6212	the Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of
6213	religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and
6214	woolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth
6215	century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of
6216	their cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades
6217	twenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all
6218	during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.
6219	Although no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish
6220	and the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of
6221	the entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.
6222	
6223	[Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH
6224	IMMIGRANTS]
6225	
6226	These newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,
6227	Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon
6228	the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard
6229	already taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people
6230	settling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the land,
6231	laid out their small farms, and worked as "sturdy yeomen on the soil,"
6232	hardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the
6233	luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely
6234	merchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen
6235	manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless
6236	women, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in
6237	the colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:
6238	
6239	        "O, willing hands to toil;
6240	    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;
6241	    Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field."
6242	
6243	=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical
6244	importance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in
6245	colonial records. A number of the artisans and carpenters in the first
6246	Jamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous
6247	governor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and
6248	Jacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial
6249	administration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The
6250	wholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.
6251	Penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his
6252	lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine
6253	country. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company, bought
6254	more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a
6255	center at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants. In old
6256	New York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for
6257	distribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered
6258	to the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in
6259	time, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that
6260	German princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and
6261	England was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas
6262	dominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the
6263	colonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two
6264	hundred thousand.
6265	
6266	The majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South
6267	Germany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove
6268	them forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also
6269	among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of
6270	industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,
6271	dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the
6272	wealth and independence of the province.
6273	
6274	[Illustration: _From an old print_
6275	
6276	A GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]
6277	
6278	Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the
6279	original colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,
6280	built their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published
6281	their own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors
6282	and led to occasional agitations against "foreigners." However, no
6283	serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the
6284	Revolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot
6285	armies side by side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish
6286	sections.
6287	
6288	=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the
6289	Germans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other
6290	racial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing
6291	their share to colonial life.
6292	
6293	From France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which
6294	inflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.
6295	
6296	From "Old Ireland" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and
6297	Catholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,
6298	they revered neither the government nor the church of England imposed
6299	upon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping
6300	records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left
6301	the southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.
6302	Undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native
6303	stock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of
6304	Celtic names in the records of various colonies.
6305	
6306	[Illustration:_From an old print_

6308	OLD DUTCH FORT AND ENGLISH CHURCH NEAR ALBANY]
6309	
6310	The Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious
6311	and economic toleration, found in the American colonies, not complete
6312	liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,
6313	France, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize
6314	their right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going
6315	habits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard
6316	towns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occasion the
6317	mayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on
6318	another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,
6319	Philadelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large
6320	Jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,
6321	flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.
6322	
6323	Though the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged
6324	beneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued
6325	to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English
6326	conquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the
6327	170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original
6328	Dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and
6329	manners of New York. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother
6330	tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;
6331	but they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in
6332	beside them to farm and trade.
6333	
6334	The melting pot had begun its historic mission.
6335	
6336	
6337	THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION
6338	
6339	Considered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the
6340	emigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay
6341	for their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on
6342	the way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,
6343	Scotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.
6344	
6345	=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America
6346	in colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,
6347	and paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists were able
6348	to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.
6349	Undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the
6350	family fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority
6351	for the statement that "the settlers of New England were drawn from the
6352	country gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother
6353	country.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists
6354	show, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and
6355	good standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration
6356	is usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left
6357	behind." Though it would be interesting to know how accurate this
6358	statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as
6359	yet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an
6360	unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the
6361	cost of their own transfer to the New World.
6362	
6363	=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants
6364	were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of
6365	a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great
6366	barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost
6367	of the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out
6368	whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage
6369	money to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a
6370	term of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called
6371	indentured servitude.
6372	
6373	It is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original
6374	twenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the
6375	Huguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to
6376	Georgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,
6377	women, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from
6378	five to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond
6379	servants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other
6380	promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till
6381	their fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the
6382	moon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.
6383	Every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,
6384	and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing
6385	servants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with
6386	fifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds
6387	of all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the
6388	eighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.
6389	In the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but
6390	it formed a considerable part of the population.
6391	
6392	The story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking
6393	things in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the
6394	feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.
6395	They likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had
6396	a time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It
6397	was, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far
6398	heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. A free
6399	citizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
6400	let off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct
6401	was whipped at the post and fined as well.
6402	
6403	The ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. A
6404	bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in
6405	trade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or
6406	indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.
6407	The condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, "was
6408	little better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put
6409	them at the mercy of their masters." It would not be unfair to add that
6410	such was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the
6411	temper of their masters.
6412	
6413	Cruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the
6414	Old World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate
6415	for freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude
6416	were over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or
6417	settle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble
6418	proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise
6419	out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude
6420	carried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real
6421	avenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America
6422	have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.
6423	
6424	=The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure
6425	settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America
6426	either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,
6427	and children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was
6428	officially estimated that "ten thousand persons were spirited away" to
6429	America. Many of the victims of the practice were young children, for
6430	the traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were
6431	sometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.
6432	In a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to
6433	Virginia.
6434	
6435	In this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few
6436	romances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands from
6437	their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and
6438	weavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. A few thus
6439	dragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of
6440	five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with
6441	fortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea
6442	lived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a
6443	peerage.
6444	
6445	Akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts
6446	deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The
6447	Americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.
6448	Indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the "criminals" were
6449	only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant
6450	caught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl
6451	who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with
6452	sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders
6453	were "political criminals"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed
6454	the government. This class included now Irish who revolted against
6455	British rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against
6456	the Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the
6457	monarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who
6458	joined in political uprisings against the king.
6459	
6460	=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the
6461	indentured servants and whites carried to America against their will
6462	were the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When
6463	this form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was
6464	looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase
6465	of the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters
6466	who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a
6467	system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery
6468	take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor
6469	supply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there
6470	were only three hundred Africans in Virginia.
6471	
6472	The great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the
6473	inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in
6474	New England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,
6475	they crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal
6476	African Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five
6477	to ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far
6478	behind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.
6479	
6480	As the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily
6481	rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,
6482	the Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail
6483	the importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave. This effort was
6484	futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time
6485	similar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South
6486	Carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure
6487	was killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted
6488	by a century of rebuffs, sent to George III a petition in this vein:
6489	"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa
6490	hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its
6491	present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger
6492	the very existence of Your Majesty's American dominions.... Deeply
6493	impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to
6494	remove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony
6495	which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
6496	pernicious a commerce."
6497	
6498	All such protests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps
6499	and bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than
6500	half a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,
6501	and Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites
6502	in number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the
6503	population. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania
6504	about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the
6505	proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was
6506	on the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one
6507	in six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few
6508	freedmen.
6509	
6510	The climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were
6511	all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,
6512	though sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern
6513	ships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the
6514	plantations to Europe. "If the Northern states will consult their
6515	interest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will
6516	increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers," said
6517	John Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the
6518	Constitution of the United States. "What enriches a part enriches the
6519	whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,"
6520	responded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.

6612	COLONIAL AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, AND COMMERCE
6613	
6614	THE LAND AND THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT
6615	
6616	
6617	=The Significance of Land Tenure.=--The way in which land may be
6618	acquired, held, divided among heirs, and bought and sold exercises a
6619	deep influence on the life and culture of a people. The feudal and
6620	aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism
6621	which was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,
6622	the land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single
6623	proprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the
6624	law of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his
6625	landed property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of
6626	estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders
6627	owning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude
6628	inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also
6629	enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing
6630	class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and
6631	political control. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was
6632	equally important in the development of America, where practically all
6633	the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their
6634	livelihood from the soil.
6635	
6636	=Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad
6637	extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to
6638	introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords
6639	and tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that almost
6640	every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,
6641	was tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though
6642	owned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No
6643	man had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:
6644	"Labor and share alike." All were supposed to work in the fields and
6645	receive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims
6646	attempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and
6647	distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among
6648	the workers.
6649	
6650	In both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the
6651	lazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular
6652	meals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: "Everyone that gathereth
6653	not every day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the
6654	river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve." Even
6655	this terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until
6656	each man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered
6657	the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where
6658	the communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar
6659	to those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate
6660	fields in which every person could "set corn for his own particular."
6661	Some other New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of
6662	their Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and
6663	labor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of
6664	the land. "By degrees it was seen that even the Lord's people could not
6665	carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
6666	practice."
6667	
6668	=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and
6669	Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of
6670	land tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions
6671	of the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact
6672	a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He
6673	could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in
6674	large or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of
6675	baronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any
6676	considerable part of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either
6677	sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on
6678	condition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as
6679	"quit rent." In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as
6680	$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this
6681	source. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual
6682	tribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,
6683	the king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from the
6684	land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit
6685	rent,--"really a feudal payment from freeholders,"--was thus a material
6686	source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever
6687	it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant
6688	irritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of
6689	grievances which led to the American Revolution.
6690	
6691	Something still more like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in
6692	the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the
6693	companies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there
6694	were sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and
6695	tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of
6696	tenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of
6697	which originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when
6698	extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over
6699	settlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston
6700	manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a
6701	representative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on the New
6702	York manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European
6703	estates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they
6704	ground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial
6705	power because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances
6706	extending to capital punishment.
6707	
6708	The manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence
6709	as compared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge
6710	estates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by
6711	slaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten
6712	that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large
6713	section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of
6714	America.
6715	
6716	[Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]
6717	
6718	=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and
6719	throughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms of
6720	servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,
6721	the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his
6722	family. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the
6723	immigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of
6724	labor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the
6725	crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In
6726	many sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,
6727	the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a
6728	moderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and
6729	German peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did not
6730	propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they
6731	could not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced
6732	proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in
6733	small lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions
6734	became the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the
6735	farms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold
6736	system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.
6737	
6738	[Illustration: _From an old print_
6739	
6740	A NEW ENGLAND FARMHOUSE]
6741	
6742	=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western
6743	settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the
6744	same pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both
6745	cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence
6746	which arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,
6747	however, differed widely.
6748	
6749	The Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the
6750	English landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who
6751	labored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice
6752	and tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his
6753	entire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,
6754	silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the
6755	ripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford
6756	or Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very largely for
6757	his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the
6758	Old World. He did not even need market towns in which to buy native
6759	goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who
6760	were usually gifted slaves.
6761	
6762	The economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His
6763	crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with English
6764	factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed
6765	local markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,
6766	weavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him
6767	with the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought
6768	by the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not
6769	buy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and
6770	between him and the European market stood the merchant. His community
6771	was therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great
6772	plantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,
6773	more American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New
6774	West.
6775	
6776	=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in
6777	one respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of
6778	an expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as
6779	a foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration
6780	set in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over
6781	mountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap
6782	lands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path
6783	breakers to the West were native Americans of the second and third
6784	generations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the
6785	mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following
6786	their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back
6787	stories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular
6788	settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes
6789	singly and sometimes in companies.
6790	
6791	In Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of
6792	Springfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the
6793	eighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west
6794	until their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New
6795	York, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,
6796	and from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,
6797	particularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early
6798	filled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of New
6799	Brunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In
6800	Pennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lines of
6801	advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,
6802	spread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying
6803	out Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by the
6804	Susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank
6805	where Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of counties
6806	a thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching
6807	the upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn
6808	family.
6809	
6810	In the South the westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was
6811	quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the
6812	cultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from
6813	the coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams
6814	of migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the
6815	other colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing
6816	the main supply. "By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing
6817	and the 'back country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully
6818	occupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.
6819	Before the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of
6820	home-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies."
6821	
6822	[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]
6823	
6824	Beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an
6825	invasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As
6826	early as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt
6827	buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the
6828	Cumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the
6829	plow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers
6830	followed the trail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the
6831	Transylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier
6832	times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit
6833	rents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution
6834	there were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older
6835	colonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked
6836	the Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the
6837	Continental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our "embryo
6838	fourteenth colony."
6839	
6840	
6841	INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
6842	
6843	Though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was
6844	a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the
6845	staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their
6846	beginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
6847	towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their
6848	numbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard
6849	originated in the days when the king of England was "lord of these
6850	dominions."
6851	
6852	[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]
6853	
6854	=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in
6855	addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor
6856	of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry
6857	which was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised in
6858	abundance in the North and South. "Every farm house," says Coman, the
6859	economic historian, "was a workshop where the women spun and wove the
6860	serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear."
6861	By the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth
6862	in sufficient quantities to export it to the Southern colonies and to
6863	the West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the
6864	more difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and
6865	spinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,
6866	the Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior "were not
6867	one whit behind their Yankee neighbors."
6868	
6869	The importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be
6870	overestimated. For many a century the English had employed their fine
6871	woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the
6872	government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and
6873	protection. When the colonies were established, both merchants and
6874	statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;
6875	but before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of
6876	the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of
6877	customers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon
6878	English markets, here was the germ of economic independence.
6879	
6880	If British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of
6881	trade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news
6882	to them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal
6883	governor of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home
6884	government: "The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves
6885	once, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of
6886	England, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government
6887	will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured
6888	in their breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort
6889	of people this country is inhabited by."
6890	
6891	=The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron
6892	working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial
6893	industries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within
6894	fifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began
6895	at New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,
6896	Connecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in
6897	1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had
6898	iron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the
6899	colony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and
6900	the Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then
6901	laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of
6902	the great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the
6903	year that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon
6904	lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.
6905	Governor Spotswood was called the "Tubal Cain" of the Old Dominion
6906	because he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems
6907	that every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,
6908	metallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large
6909	quantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the
6910	colonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.
6911	
6912	=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,
6913	shipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak
6914	for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope
6915	made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a
6916	ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century
6917	shipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,
6918	Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.
6919	Yards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade
6920	of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia
6921	soon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal
6922	the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South
6923	Carolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the
6924	lucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and
6925	tar.
6926	
6927	=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside
6928	of agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy
6929	sailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished
6930	under the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the
6931	net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. "Look,"
6932	exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, "at the manner in
6933	which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale
6934	fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and
6935	behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay
6936	and Davis's Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic
6937	circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar
6938	cold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen
6939	serpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging
6940	to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst
6941	some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of
6942	Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along
6943	the coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No
6944	climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of
6945	Holland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
6946	of English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard
6947	industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent
6948	people."
6949	
6950	The influence of the business was widespread. A large and lucrative
6951	European trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught
6952	for food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or
6953	exchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The
6954	lower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave
6955	consumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished
6956	the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These
6957	activities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the
6958	demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the
6959	shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport
6960	towns rushed with work. They also increased trade with the mother
6961	country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and
6962	the West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an
6963	ever-widening circle of American enterprise centered around this single
6964	industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.
6965	
6966	=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth
6967	century, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction
6968	until it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,
6969	and the profits gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A modern
6970	historian has said: "The enterprising merchants of New England developed
6971	a network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world." This
6972	commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the
6973	mother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.
6974	
6975	On the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and
6976	agricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,
6977	tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,
6978	furs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,
6979	and small articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact
6980	astounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an
6981	American union, once remarked of colonial trade: "What sort of dish will
6982	you make? New England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,
6983	flax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North
6984	Carolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,
6985	and Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an
6986	absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such
6987	discordant materials as the thirteen British provinces."
6988	
6989	On the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,
6990	consisting principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and
6991	"India goods." Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,
6992	supplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
6993	and Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern
6994	colonies engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of

6997	The disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part
6998	controlled by English factors located in America, employed also a large
6999	and important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises
7000	of Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the
7001	Livingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they
7002	were worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for
7003	world-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages
7004	they enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British
7005	navy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to
7006	contend with royal officers in order to shield American interests
7007	against outside interference.

7011	
7012	Measured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce
7013	seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its
7014	significance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English
7015	colonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few
7016	startling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to
7017	the colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. On the eve of the American
7018	Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies
7019	alone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the
7020	whole foreign business of England two generations before. At the first
7021	date, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;
7022	at the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. In 1704,
7023	Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of $11,459; in
7024	1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507,909. In short,
7025	Pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,
7026	amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the
7027	colonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were
7028	indeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.
7029	
7030	=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made
7031	overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and
7032	harbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the
7033	colonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in
7034	the North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for
7035	goods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little
7036	sailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,
7037	domestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,
7038	or Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up
7039	the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange
7040	the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.
7041	Larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New
7042	England to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,
7043	leather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut
7044	shores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to
7045	Maryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.
7046	
7047	=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry
7048	there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers
7049	which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole
7050	British empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such
7051	ports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are
7052	mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among
7053	these towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,
7054	and western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the
7055	Revolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with
7056	somewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the "commercial capital of
7057	Connecticut and old East Jersey," was slightly smaller than Boston, but
7058	growing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South
7059	Carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a
7060	center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population
7061	of about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as "considerable
7062	towns." In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in
7063	Pennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and
7064	increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the
7065	seaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,
7066	Virginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a
7067	dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county
7068	seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,
7069	and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the
7070	sessions of the court.
7071	
7072	The leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of
7073	proportion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one
7074	thing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and
7075	artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising
7076	from their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for news,
7077	gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market
7078	places the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and
7079	laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main
7080	currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and
7081	independence.

7155	SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS
7156	
7157	
7158	Colonial life, crowded as it was with hard and unremitting toil, left
7159	scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. There was
7160	little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to
7161	schools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to read long
7162	and widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that
7163	delight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the
7164	intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic
7165	efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane
7166	of mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests
7167	those efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the
7168	thought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with
7169	England, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,
7170	political philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy
7171	itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American
7172	intellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the
7173	writings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts to
7174	Georgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,
7175	Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,
7176	and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was
7177	something in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and
7178	power. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the
7179	process of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is
7180	evident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her
7181	husband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,
7182	the sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British
7183	propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.
7184	
7185	
7186	THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES
7187	
7188	In the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of high
7189	importance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the
7190	colonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impulse
7191	had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all
7192	the colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only
7193	class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached
7194	on Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of
7195	local problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of
7196	which was concerned with the relation between church and state. They
7197	wrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the
7198	colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the
7199	Americans received their formal education. In several of the provinces
7200	the Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Puritans
7201	were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their
7202	authority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of
7203	sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in
7204	all of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in
7205	time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.
7206	
7207	=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English
7208	system of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were
7209	prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the
7210	governor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. "The
7211	Established Church," says Lodge, "was one of the appendages of the
7212	Virginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,
7213	and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the
7214	planter who built and managed it." As in England, Catholics and
7215	Protestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only
7216	slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when
7217	once they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,
7218	by the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established
7219	order.
7220	
7221	The Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the
7222	Carolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly
7223	under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of
7224	the inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics
7225	it was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, too,
7226	notwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was
7227	fostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about
7228	one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of
7229	proportion to their numbers.
7230	
7231	Many factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the
7232	colonies. It was supported by the British government and the official
7233	class sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England
7234	were appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by
7235	acts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it
7236	could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so
7237	counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in
7238	America. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had
7239	a political role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing
7240	leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth
7241	century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the
7242	Church in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to
7243	calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting
7244	Protestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts
7245	in the mother country.
7246	
7247	=Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial
7248	unity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims
7249	had cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a
7250	separate and independent congregation before they came to America. The
7251	Puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,
7252	soon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke
7253	of union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was
7254	organized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the
7255	other officers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where
7256	secular matters were determined. The union of church and government was
7257	thus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and
7258	enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy
7259	instead of imperial unity.
7260	
7261	The clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and
7262	their fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for
7263	the people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and
7264	eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the
7265	civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan
7266	Sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and
7267	lasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and
7268	all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.
7269	A thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church
7270	was in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout
7271	Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback
7272	one Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike
7273	him through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court
7274	and fined for "his ungodly conduct." With persons accused of witchcraft
7275	the Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept
7276	over Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed
7277	to death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.
7278	
7279	Just about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of
7280	Puritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it
7281	with disfavor, and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the old charter of
7282	the Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven years later
7283	wrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own
7284	governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. It also
7285	abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting
7286	for it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an
7287	official family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in
7288	sympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious
7289	denominations, if they had the required amount of property, were
7290	permitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the
7291	crown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that
7292	province was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New
7293	Hampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the
7294	suffrage.
7295	
7296	=Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of
7297	Virginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for
7298	other denominations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode
7299	Island. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in
7300	matters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by
7301	granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jesus
7302	Christ, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to
7303	the tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those "who
7304	confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the
7305	creator, upholder, and ruler of the World." By one circumstance or
7306	another, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity
7307	rather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,
7308	Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,
7309	Catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and
7310	too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had
7311	desired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where
7312	one or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature
7313	steadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,
7314	and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.
7315	
7316	The government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with
7317	economic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English
7318	state. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy
7319	of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London.
7320	Neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
7321	articles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical
7322	helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The
7323	spirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,
7324	nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, made
7325	them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against
7326	authority imposed from without.
7327	
7328	
7329	SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES
7330	
7331	=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant
7332	denomination was the education of the children in the faith. In this
7333	work the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was
7334	indeed the one book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,
7335	whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in
7336	the Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a
7337	book of romance, travel, and history. "Legend and annal," says John
7338	Richard Green, "war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty
7339	voices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission
7340	journeys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,
7341	apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for
7342	the most part by any rival learning.... As a mere literary monument, the
7343	English version of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English
7344	tongue." It was the King James version just from the press that the
7345	Pilgrims brought across the sea with them.
7346	
7347	For the authority of the Established Church was substituted the
7348	authority of the Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechism based upon
7349	their interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in
7350	America, they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent
7351	in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious
7352	works and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was
7353	scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was
7354	declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools
7355	where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and
7356	writing.

7378	
7379	
7380	
7381	Outside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded
7382	with the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with
7383	little schools kept by "dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons."
7384	Whether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in
7385	the South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes
7386	girls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,
7387	fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments
7388	of learning. Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show
7389	that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady
7390	progress all through the eighteenth century.
7391	
7392	=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the
7393	establishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in
7394	1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train
7395	"learned and godly ministers" for the Puritan churches of New England.
7396	To the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a
7397	mission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England
7398	farmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College of New
7399	Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,
7400	was sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the
7401	Established Church as their source of inspiration and support: William
7402	and Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia
7403	University, chartered by King George II in 1754, on an appeal from the
7404	New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the
7405	"republican tendencies" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away
7406	from sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the
7407	Philadelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,
7408	organized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by
7409	giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious
7410	sects. It was Franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men
7411	to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to
7412	their country.
7413	
7414	=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of
7415	learning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.
7416	Many well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in
7417	England. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families
7418	there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school
7419	of adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind
7420	and wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or
7421	any other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose
7422	charming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a
7423	fine record of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was
7424	limited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his
7425	self-education continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal
7426	for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on
7427	theology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's
7428	_On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with
7429	secular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,
7430	Franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the
7431	_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely
7432	in natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of
7433	European savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts
7434	he "attained an acquaintance" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,
7435	thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak
7436	for all America at the court of the king of France.
7437	
7438	Lesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found
7439	all over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,
7440	self-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of
7441	the Revolution.
7442	
7443	
7444	THE COLONIAL PRESS
7445	
7446	=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a
7447	government by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of
7448	political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That
7449	too, like education, was a matter of slow growth. A printing press was
7450	brought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an
7451	official censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty
7452	years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious
7453	title, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not
7454	been running very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed
7455	it for discussing a political question.
7456	
7457	Publishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704
7458	there came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,
7459	which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from
7460	criticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languished. When
7461	Franklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_
7462	about 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one
7463	newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his
7464	confidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette
7465	or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjamin
7466	Franklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five
7467	newspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English
7468	and one in German.
7469	
7470	=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,
7471	unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,
7472	however, slow in taking form. The founders of the American colonies had
7473	never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,
7474	pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was
7475	first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical
7476	authorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in
7477	the reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal
7478	prerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;
7479	and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the
7480	official censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,
7481	with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence
7482	royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the
7483	restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed
7484	in royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by
7485	failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official
7486	
7487	censorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so
7488	active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all
7489	published matter became a sheer impossibility.
7490	
7491	In America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection
7492	with freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less
7493	anxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from
7494	the prying eyes of the people all literature "not mete for them to
7495	read"; and so they established a system of official licensing for
7496	presses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was
7497	more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with
7498	impunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for
7499	printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the
7500	editor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the
7501	proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,
7502	and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.
7503	A still more famous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,
7504	who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who
7505	ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to
7506	practice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from
7507	Philadelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the
7508	approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the
7509	defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not
7510	that of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it
7511	finally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.
7512	Already the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing
7513	is the freedom of the press.
7514	
7515	Thanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the
7516	vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of
7517	the colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and
7518	almanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the
7519	course of public events and grasp the significance of political
7520	arguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--an
7521	independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions
7522	around the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to
7523	British rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every person
7524	who could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a
7525	thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had
7526	spelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richard's
7527	Almanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.
7528	
7529	
7530	THE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS
7531	
7532	Two very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.
7533	The one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the
7534	drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in
7535	England. The other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was
7536	the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each
7537	movement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the
7538	passing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals
7539	of government came in the war of independence.
7540	
7541	=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were
7542	royal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia
7543	passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of
7544	the London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost
7545	its charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later
7546	stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In
7547	the early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were
7548	given the provincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,
7549	severed from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the
7550	trustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,
7551	transferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,
7552	became a province when he took the title of James II in 1685. New
7553	Jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was
7554	brought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
7555	Delaware, although they retained their proprietary character until the
7556	Revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their
7557	governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees
7558	of King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,
7559	retained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone
7560	had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.
7561	
7562	The chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed
7563	high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every
7564	turn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,
7565	appointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and
7566	reprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief
7567	of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in
7568	time of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except
7569	Massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of
7570	the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.
7571	He summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower
7572	house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and
7573	he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America
7574	all the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had
7575	protested and Cromwell had battled in England.
7576	
7577	[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]
7578	
7579	The colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of
7580	office-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen
7581	of broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The
7582	pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges
7583	granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen
7584	popular antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to
7585	adherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The
7586	reappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which
7587	they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.
7588	
7589	=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward
7590	administration through royal governors was the second and opposite
7591	tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.
7592	The voters of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and
7593	law-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early
7594	introduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when
7595	its first representative assembly appeared. As the towns of
7596	Massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of
7597	the corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was
7598	adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative
7599	system under their "Fundamental Orders" of 1639, and the entire colony
7600	was given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical
7601	considerations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William
7602	Penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any
7603	considerable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every
7604	one of the colonies secured a popular assembly.
7605	
7606	It is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was
7607	finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning
7608	toward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to
7609	be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no
7610	house on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.
7611	In Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter
7612	of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year
7613	at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. In
7614	Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres
7615	or more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons
7616	worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.
7617	
7618	Restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very
7619	considerable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of
7620	the towns, who were by no means content with their position.
7621	Nevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small
7622	freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion
7623	of the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the
7624	limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.
7625	
7626	The popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged
7627	in battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called upon by
7628	the executive to make provision for the support of the administration,
7629	the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the
7630	interest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of
7631	money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a
7632	treasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the
7633	mysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious
7634	officials. The legislature also used its power over money grants to
7635	force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.
7636	
7637	=Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many
7638	and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors
7639	and the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how
7640	the Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to
7641	sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly
7642	humor, Franklin adds: "Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our
7643	proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in
7644	legislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own
7645	before can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the value
7646	of money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so
7647	blessed."
7648	
7649	It must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily
7650	as Franklin's tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like
7651	Caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon
7652	executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If
7653	we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America
7654	was diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the
7655	friends of the governor complained in 1747 that "the inhabitants of
7656	plantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon
7657	republican principles all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of
7658	royal authority remains in the Northern colonies." "Here," echoed the
7659	governor of South Carolina, the following year, "levelling principles
7660	prevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if
7661	he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their
7662	whole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the
7663	assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical
7664	preferments, are in the disposal or election of the people."
7665	
7666	Though baffled by the "levelling principles" of the colonial assemblies,
7667	the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved
7668	a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the
7669	obstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters
7670	to the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal
7671	officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures
7672	by taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was
7673	to be maintained in America; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to
7674	be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.
7675	
7676	Such a system seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many
7677	ministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army
7678	independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry
7679	out both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both
7680	practical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh
7681	from the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It
7682	failed to take account of the fact that the American people were growing
7683	strong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the
7684	tutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or
7685	how benevolent its intentions.

7766	CHAPTER IV
7767	
7768	THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLONIAL NATIONALISM
7769	
7770	
7771	It is one of the well-known facts of history that a people loosely
7772	united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature, even a
7773	people torn by domestic strife, may be welded into a solid and compact
7774	body by an attack from a foreign power. The imperative call to common
7775	defense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common
7776	service--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting outside
7777	interference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,
7778	perhaps, the most discordant. The presence of the enemy allays the most
7779	virulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. "Politics," runs an old
7780	saying, "stops at the water's edge."
7781	
7782	This ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic
7783	circles, applied nearly as well to the original thirteen American
7784	colonies as to the countries of Europe. The necessity for common
7785	defense, if not equally great, was certainly always pressing. Though it
7786	has long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded
7787	in "a wilderness," this was not actually the case. From the earliest
7788	days of Jamestown on through the years, the American people were
7789	confronted by dangers from without. All about their tiny settlements
7790	were Indians, growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and
7791	as sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions. To the south and
7792	west was the power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to
7793	the Armada, but still presenting an imposing front to the British
7794	empire. To the north and west were the French, ambitious, energetic,
7795	imperial in temper, and prepared to contest on land and water the
7796	advance of British dominion in America.
7797	
7798	
7799	RELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH
7800	
7801	=Indian Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general statements about the
7802	relations of the colonists to the Indians. The problem was presented in
7803	different shape in different sections of America. It was not handled
7804	according to any coherent or uniform plan by the British government,
7805	which alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time. Neither
7806	did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an
7807	irregular train, have the consistent policy or the matured experience
7808	necessary for dealing wisely with Indian matters. As the difficulties
7809	arose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers
7810	were making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened
7811	was the result of chance rather than of calculation. A personal quarrel
7812	between traders and an Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the
7813	exchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper
7814	often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.
7815	
7816	On one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of
7817	Squanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of
7818	Roger Williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of William
7819	Penn treating with them on his arrival in America. On the other side of
7820	the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the
7821	frontier rolled westward with deadly precision. The Pequots on the
7822	Connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements
7823	with awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. A
7824	generation later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the
7825	Pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought
7826	the strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own
7827	destruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially
7828	with the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and
7829	desperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New
7830	England. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the
7831	Jamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he
7832	attempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.
7833	Nathaniel Bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up
7834	an adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt
7835	and a successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia
7836	outposts advanced into the Kentucky country, the strife with the natives
7837	was transferred to that "dark and bloody ground"; while to the
7838	southeast, a desperate struggle with the Tuscaroras called forth the
7839	combined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.

7845	From such horrors New Jersey and Delaware were saved on account of their
7846	geographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of
7847	conciliation, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into
7848	full conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia, by clever
7849	negotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms
7850	with her belligerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither diplomacy nor
7851	generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,
7852	especially after the French soldiers enlisted the Indians in their
7853	imperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting became general
7854	warfare.
7855	
7856	[Illustration: ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND SPANISH POSSESSIONS IN AMERICA,

7858	
7859	=Early Relations with the French.=--During the first decades of French
7860	exploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English
7861	colonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought
7862	to their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, in
7863	1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in
7864	strength to be much of a menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It was
7865	the statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in
7866	America, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging
7867	empires in North America. It was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,
7868	rather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that
7869	sounded the first note of colonial alarm.
7870	
7871	Evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the
7872	English and the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on
7873	the Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's
7874	War (1701-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) owed their origins
7875	and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European
7876	powers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles
7877	with the French and their savage allies.
7878	
7879	=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly
7880	closed, however, before the English colonists themselves began to be
7881	seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the
7882	West. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,
7883	who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed
7884	by the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus
7885	taking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.
7886	Lawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they
7887	occupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion
7888	over all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this
7889	lofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years
7890	1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper
7891	waters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the
7892	streams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington,
7893	in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory "so
7894	notoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain," the
7895	French showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.
7896

7899	BRADDOCK'S RETREAT]
7900	
7901	=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the
7902	shot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French
7903	and Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the
7904	conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved
7905	England and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and
7906	minor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in
7907	1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the
7908	dramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized
7909	Prussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the
7910	Ganges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were
7911	triumphant. Well could the historian write: "Conquests equaling in
7912	rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had
7913	been achieved in the East." Well could the merchants of London declare
7914	that under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of
7915	this world-wide conflict, commerce had been "united with and made to
7916	flourish by war."
7917	
7918	From the point of view of the British empire, the results of the war
7919	were momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of
7920	the Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The
7921	remainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French
7922	imperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In
7923	exchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war, Spain
7924	ceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did
7925	Macaulay write in after years that Pitt "was the first Englishman of his
7926	time; and he had made England the first country in the world."
7927	
7928	
7929	THE EFFECTS OF WARFARE ON THE COLONIES
7930	
7931	The various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as
7932	they seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the
7933	destiny of America. Circumstances beyond the control of popular
7934	assemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation
7935	among them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooperation. The
7936	American people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their
7937	trades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the
7938	arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of
7939	statecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so
7940	tenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.
7941	
7942	=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with
7943	the problems presented by the Indian and French menace that the
7944	Americans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many
7945	common ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly
7946	fear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,
7947	composed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The
7948	colonies so united were bound together in "a firm and perpetual league
7949	of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and
7950	succor, upon all just occasions." They made provision for distributing
7951	the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of
7952	commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For
7953	some twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold
7954	meetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate
7955	border.
7956	
7957	Virginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of
7958	intercolonial cooperation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the
7959	Old Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the
7960	colonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany
7961	with the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of
7962	mutual defense. A few years later the Old Dominion cooperated loyally
7963	with the Carolinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.
7964	
7965	=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was
7966	made in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a
7967	conference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise
7968	measures of defense against the French, and to enter into "articles of
7969	union and confederation for the general defense of his Majesty's
7970	subjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of
7971	war." New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,
7972	Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a
7973	plan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was
7974	adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. The
7975	colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the
7976	scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that
7977	it had "too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution."
7978	Though the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study
7979	because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved
7980	until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which
7981	also Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the United
7982	States.
7983	
7984	[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]
7985	
7986	=The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed
7987	the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art
7988	of defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last
7989	French and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine to
7990	the Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,
7991	it is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British government and
7992	the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands
7993	of Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the
7994	field. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that
7995	were not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen
7996	could do under favorable circumstances and they watched British regulars
7997	operating on American soil. "This whole transaction," shrewdly remarked
7998	Franklin of Braddock's campaign, "gave us Americans the first suspicion
7999	that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not
8000	been well founded." It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel
8001	who drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the
8002	army of the Revolution was the brave officer who had "spurned the
8003	whistle of bullets" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.
8004	
8005	=Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were
8006	learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the
8007	conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip's war left
8008	New England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was
8009	especially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by
8010	the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper
8011	currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce
8012	was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the
8013	end came, both England and America were staggering under heavy
8014	liabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices
8015	accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of
8016	ten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
8017	had to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel
8018	which led to American independence.
8019	
8020	=The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the
8021	defeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to
8022	estimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance
8023	that the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no
8024	foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.
8025	American leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis
8026	were driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country
8027	to fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,
8028	though defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,
8029	as events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by
8030	Franklin that assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the
8031	Revolution.
8032	
8033	
8034	COLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
8035	
8036	It was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought
8037	forth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife
8038	with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of
8039	independence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in the
8040	colonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of
8041	events in English domestic politics, and English measures of control
8042	over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be
8043	taken into account.
8044	
8045	=The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)
8046	and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan regime
8047	(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had
8048	little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial
8049	affairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by
8050	internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the
8051	House of Commons, changed all that. In the reign of Charles II
8052	(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade
8053	by act of Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and
8054	powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same
8055	time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by
8056	the annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so
8057	much self-government on the Puritans.
8058	
8059	Charles' successor, James II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his
8060	authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus
8061	inaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he
8062	would have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his
8063	dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.
8064	He determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more
8065	efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He
8066	made a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New
8067	York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last
8068	days of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of
8069	Connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and
8070	hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.
8071	
8072	For several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of
8073	ill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not
8074	accustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his
8075	opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the
8076	Old South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to
8077	a preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middle
8078	of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came
8079	that King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people
8080	of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to
8081	dispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated
8082	governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under
8083	guard.
8084	
8085	The overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary
8086	and by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the
8087	colonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was
8088	given another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,
8089	restored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. In the
8090	other colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of
8091	affairs was resumed.
8092	
8093	=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of
8094	Queen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a
8095	Hanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,
8096	was more interested in Hanover than in England. George I and George II,
8097	whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to
8098	speak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of
8099	taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the
8100	stoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no
8101	ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.
8102	Moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs
8103	was in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed
8104	his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: "Let
8105	sleeping dogs lie." He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment
8106	by exclaiming: "I will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the
8107	expense of blood." Such kings and such ministers were not likely to
8108	arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the
8109	sea.
8110	
8111	=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from
8112	James II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matters
8113	personally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal
8114	officers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision
8115	began in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the
8116	king's council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider
8117	petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696
8118	a regular board was established, known as the "Lords of Trade and
8119	Plantations," which continued, until the American Revolution, to
8120	scrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were
8121	to examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those
8122	assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the
8123	colonies relative to their affairs.
8124	
8125	The methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by
8126	American legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.
8127	If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the
8128	exercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person
8129	who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law
8130	could be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it
8131	was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so
8132	involved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,
8133	therefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the
8134	suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in
8135	addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal
8136	provinces.
8137	
8138	=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the
8139	colonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The
8140	king, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high
8141	appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right
8142	of appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,
8143	on the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in
8144	England or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by
8145	any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,
8146	had the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the
8147	king in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In
8148	the exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court
8149	could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly
8150	enacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were
8151	contrary to English law.
8152	
8153	=Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year
8154	after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over
8155	colonial affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in
8156	the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a
8157	duty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North
8158	Carolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as
8159	"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures
8160	throughout the continent." At other times, Indian trade was regulated in
8161	the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial
8162	legislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to
8163	North Carolina lest there should be retaliation.
8164	
8165	In short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control
8166	higher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the
8167	Constitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to
8168	regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.
8169	A superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the
8170	Supreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the
8171	colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. In
8172	the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the
8173	rulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of
8174	British imperial control over the American colonies.
8175	
8176	So great was the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies
8177	had to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As
8178	common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control
8179	arose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with
8180	the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their
8181	enterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a
8182	common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the
8183	repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of
8184	Parliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.
8185	
8186	=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament
8187	gained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the
8188	American colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of
8189	Charles I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense
8190	body of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of
8191	America. All of it, based on the "mercantile" theory then prevalent in
8192	all countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas
8193	plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business
8194	interests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had
8195	got the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the
8196	British empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of
8197	raw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.
8198	
8199	_The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measures of
8200	British colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for
8201	the purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so
8202	essential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and
8203	French. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and
8204	it was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II
8205	(1660-85).
8206	
8207	The Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
8208	British ships. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and
8209	her dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No
8210	European goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the
8211	country that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were
8212	almost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the
8213	colonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse
8214	effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated
8215	shipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave
8216	the master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother
8217	country. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive
8218	policy written into the Navigation Acts.
8219	
8220	_The Acts against Manufactures._--The second group of laws was
8221	deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too
8222	sharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may
8223	be counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen
8224	goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and
8225	colonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New
8226	England and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending
8227	large numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,
8228	and Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that "no hats or felts,
8229	dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished" should be "put upon any vessel
8230	or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place
8231	whatever." The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost
8232	ruinous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron
8233	industry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were
8234	given free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw
8235	material; but at the same time the law provided that "no mill or other
8236	engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a
8237	tilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel" should be built in the
8238	colonies. As for those already built, they were declared public
8239	nuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of
8240	the colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the
8241	ban.
8242	
8243	_The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive measures passed by the
8244	British Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of
8245	1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain
8246	or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to
8247	the continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom
8248	duties and through a British merchant's hands paying the usual
8249	commission. At first tobacco was the only one of the "enumerated
8250	articles" which seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest
8251	coming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,
8252	however, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated
8253	articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,
8254	hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies
8255	were compelled to bring their European purchases back through English
8256	ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants
8257	again.
8258	
8259	_The Molasses Act._--Not content with laws enacted in the interest of
8260	English merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the
8261	British West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch
8262	neighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade
8263	with the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar
8264	and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting
8265	on the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,
8266	Parliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on
8267	sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign
8268	countries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the
8269	French and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, were
8270	not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on
8271	merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.
8272	
8273	=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly
8274	of her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the
8275	policy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the
8276	restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be
8277	favorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,
8278	redounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers
8279	of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British
8280	ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors
8281	and in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage
8282	colonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in
8283	the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the
8284	colonists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial
8285	legislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when
8286	free from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves
8287	handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders
8288	and the recipients of bounties in English markets.
8289	
8290	Be that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation
8291	against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws
8292	enacted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively
8293	few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those
8294	in farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America
8295	to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of
8296	the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women
8297	and carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was
8298	not the sole support of any considerable number of people.
8299	
8300	As a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those
8301	relating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were
8302	boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the
8303	English government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and
8304	molasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New
8305	England in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against
8306	smuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed
8307	in stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of "the galling
8308	restraints of trade" until after the French war, when the British
8309	government suddenly entered upon a new course.
8310	
8311	
8312	SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD
8313	
8314	In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,
8315	in 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of
8316	a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent
8317	to take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of
8318	migration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and
8319	nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical
8320	importance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot
8321	were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands
8322	of negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as
8323	domestic servants in the North.
8324	
8325	Why did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims
8326	and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and
8327	Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments
8328	that denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of
8329	their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in
8330	the Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the
8331	negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of
8332	adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the
8333	enterprising merchants.
8334	
8335	How did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together
8336	and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other
8337	cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it
8338	was the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who
8339	undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their
8340	own way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years
8341	in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account
8342	of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.
8343	
8344	Whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get
8345	across the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down
8346	forests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,
8347	schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and
8348	wove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and
8349	traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of
8350	commerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
8351	Charleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line
8352	they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they
8353	were already on the crest of the Alleghanies.
8354	
8355	Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,
8356	the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major
8357	portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the
8358	literature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the
8359	colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a
8360	wilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by
8361	necessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and
8362	later against the French. They were all subjects of the same
8363	sovereign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for
8364	them and the English government supervised their local affairs, their
8365	trade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common
8366	grievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.
8367	
8368	Many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
8369	them into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them
8370	were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled
8371	it with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.
8372	The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the
8373	Church of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each
8374	colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it
8375	grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a
8376	people learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to
8377	strengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of
8378	colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence
8379	which they were designed to quench.
8380	
8381	Nevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the
8382	assistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection
8383	of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from
8384	wiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were
8385	controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed
8386	great advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the
8387	earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and
8388	merchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages
8389	which the colonists suffered through British regulation of their
8390	industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.
8391	Still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is
8392	not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A
8393	thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,
8394	to inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a
8395	destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British
8396	empire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that
8397	America would be richer under the British flag, could not change the
8398	spirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George
8399	Washington.

8486	THE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY
8487	
8488	
8489	On October 25, 1760, King George II died and the British crown passed to
8490	his young grandson. The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover
8491	and Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was a thorough German who never
8492	even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned.
8493	The second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke English
8494	with an accent and until his death preferred his German home. During
8495	their reign, the principle had become well established that the king did
8496	not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in
8497	Parliament.
8498	
8499	
8500	GEORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM
8501	
8502	=The Character of the New King.=--The third George rudely broke the
8503	German tradition of his family. He resented the imputation that he was a
8504	foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.
8505	To the draft of his first speech to Parliament, he added the popular
8506	phrase: "Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of
8507	Briton." Macaulay, the English historian, certainly of no liking for
8508	high royal prerogative, said of George: "The young king was a born
8509	Englishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No
8510	portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,
8511	his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated
8512	public favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were
8513	pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without
8514	glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues."
8515	
8516	Nevertheless George III had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and
8517	his courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty
8518	notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check
8519	the pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His
8520	mother had dinned into his ears the slogan: "George, be king!" Lord
8521	Bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him
8522	to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of
8523	laws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged
8524	him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all
8525	parties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.
8526	
8527	[Illustration: _From an old print._
8528	
8529	GEORGE III]
8530	
8531	=Political Parties and George III.=--The state of the political parties
8532	favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of
8533	the crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller
8534	freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant
8535	non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long
8536	continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in
8537	their own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up
8538	all hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they
8539	still cherished their old notions about divine right. With the
8540	accession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally
8541	around the throne again. George received his Tory friends with open
8542	arms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Commons.
8543	
8544	=The British Parliamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British
8545	Parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies
8546	with their designs for controlling the entire government. In the first
8547	place, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose
8548	number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as
8549	of old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by
8550	popular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English people. Great
8551	towns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no
8552	representatives at all. While there were about eight million inhabitants
8553	in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is
8554	to say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the
8555	government. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the Commons
8556	although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no
8557	voters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by
8558	lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.
8559	The "rotten-boroughs," as they were called by reformers, were a public
8560	scandal, but George III readily made use of them to get his friends into
8561	the House of Commons.
8562	
8563	
8564	GEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES
8565	
8566	=Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of
8567	George III, William Pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him
8568	with "gross incivility" and the crowds shouting "Pitt forever!" The
8569	direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's
8570	confidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,
8571	a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing
8572	cost of government.
8573	
8574	The first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment
8575	of the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest
8576	point in the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely
8577	necessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention
8578	finally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a
8579	zealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public
8580	service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal
8581	governors in America. These two men, with the support of the entire
8582	ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, "a new system of colonial
8583	government. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more
8584	requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but
8585	that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.
8586	Colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to
8587	be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the
8588	expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation."
8589	
8590	=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed
8591	before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of
8592	paper money by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a
8593	remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws
8594	authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This
8595	law was aimed at the "cheap money" which the Americans were fond of
8596	making when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their
8597	English creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and
8598	principal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long
8599	battle over sound money on this continent.
8600	
8601	=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)
8602	George III issued a royal proclamation providing, among other things,
8603	for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of
8604	Paris from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree
8605	touched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king's
8606	officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had
8607	been long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on
8608	settlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and
8609	"squatting" on land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without
8610	authority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases
8611	from the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands
8612	and dispose of them for settlement. A second provision in the same
8613	proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,
8614	including the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in
8615	the colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise
8616	were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the
8617	preservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses.
8618	
8619	=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their
8620	attention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under
8621	which England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of
8622	America, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition
8623	that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily
8624	upon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this
8625	reasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was
8626	set forth clearly in the title: "An act for granting certain duties in
8627	the British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the
8628	produce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,
8629	protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for
8630	more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and
8631	from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the
8632	trade between the same and Great Britain." The old Molasses Act had been
8633	prohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue
8634	measure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,
8635	and many other commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement
8636	of the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had
8637	"teeth in it." Special precautions as to bonds, security, and
8638	registration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised
8639	a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.
8640	
8641	The strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative
8642	measures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed
8643	vessels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,
8644	search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial
8645	ports. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in
8646	America was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and
8647	navigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and
8648	royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty
8649	in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge
8650	of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for
8651	naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by
8652	large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.
8653	
8654	=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved
8655	steadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration
8656	in Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next
8657	year it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded
8658	its authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;
8659	while in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality
8660	of a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure received
8661	royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of
8662	colonial agents in London were futile. "We might as well have hindered
8663	the sun's progress!" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in
8664	the Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and
8665	from all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid
8666	interest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful
8667	measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to
8668	act for the king when he was incapacitated.
8669	
8670	The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British
8671	government to raise revenue in America "towards defraying the expenses
8672	of defending, protecting, and securing the British colonies and
8673	plantations in America." It was a long measure of more than fifty
8674	sections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions
8675	duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal
8676	transactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on
8677	licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing
8678	cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and
8679	advertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything
8680	escaped.
8681	
8682	=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp
8683	Act would rouse opposition in America--how great they could not
8684	conjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General
8685	Wolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous
8686	warning in the Commons. "Believe me--remember I this day told you so--"
8687	he exclaimed, "the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at
8688	first will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties
8689	and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated." The
8690	answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.
8691	Preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of
8692	soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the
8693	Stamp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the
8694	colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce
8695	the new laws. "We have the power to tax them," said one of the ministry,
8696	"and we will tax them."
8697	
8698	
8699	COLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL
8700	
8701	=Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an
8702	outburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the
8703	lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to
8704	import British goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,
8705	some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others
8706	intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped
8707	papers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had
8708	long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested
8709	against taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old
8710	England. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many
8711	of them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and
8712	Whig aristocrats as "seditious, factious and republican." Yet the
8713	opposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering
8714	Act, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.
8715	
8716	In a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the
8717	countryside. All through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,
8718	there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to
8719	resist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were
8720	known as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including
8721	artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both
8722	groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public
8723	affairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the
8724	right to vote for colonial assemblymen.
8725	
8726	While the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to
8727	drafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of
8728	Liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred
8729	up riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts
8730	were made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of
8731	high royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by
8732	threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use
8733	of stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operations
8734	to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were
8735	frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had
8736	unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very
8737	effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on
8738	domestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture
8739	of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to
8740	feed and clothe their families without buying British goods.
8741	
8742	=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial
8743	assemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the
8744	popular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,
8745	the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring
8746	that the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes
8747	upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were
8748	"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust." It was in support of these
8749	resolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: "Caesar
8750	had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III...." Cries of
8751	"Treason" were calmly met by the orator who finished: "George III may
8752	profit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it."
8753	
8754	[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]
8755	
8756	=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call
8757	of Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to
8758	be held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded
8759	and sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest
8760	affection for the king's person and government, firmly spread on record
8761	a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They
8762	declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given
8763	through their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed
8764	a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade
8765	acts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the
8766	king and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made "humble
8767	supplication" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.
8768	
8769	The Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked
8770	the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of America.
8771	It was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the
8772	government of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress
8773	of the United States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt
8774	at union. "There ought to be no New England men," declared Christopher
8775	Gadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, "no New Yorkers known on the
8776	Continent, but all of us Americans."
8777	
8778	=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American
8779	resistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies
8780	had been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging
8781	at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,
8782	Bristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England
8783	were thrown out of employment. The government had sown folly and was
8784	reaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.
8785	
8786	Perplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the
8787	bar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for
8788	Pennsylvania, who was in London. "Do you think it right," asked
8789	Grenville, "that America should be protected by this country and pay no
8790	part of the expenses?" The answer was brief: "That is not the case; the
8791	colonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five
8792	thousand men and spent many millions." Then came an inquiry whether the
8793	colonists would accept a modified stamp act. "No, never," replied
8794	Franklin, "never! They will never submit to it!" It was next suggested
8795	that military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready
8796	answer. "They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a
8797	rebellion; they may, indeed, make one."
8798	
8799	The repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days
8800	later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts
8801	due British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,
8802	workingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the
8803	colonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close
8804	of his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor
8805	of retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.
8806	"America must learn," he wailed, "that prayers are not to be brought to
8807	Caesar through riot and sedition." His protests were idle. The Commons
8808	agreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the
8809	victorious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of
8810	strong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now
8811	restored to his right mind.
8812	
8813	In rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of
8814	the Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it
8815	accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the
8816	colonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;
8817	that the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make
8818	laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the
8819	resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were
8820	null and void.
8821	
8822	The repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular
8823	demonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and
8824	trade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper
8825	resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered
8826	the name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the
8827	news that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically
8828	restoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend
8829	inaugurated their policy of "thoroughness."
8830	
8831	
8832	RESUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES
8833	
8834	=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.
8835	Though Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and
8836	seated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness
8837	gave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.
8838	Unconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought
8839	forward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,
8840	which to this day are associated with his name. First among his
8841	restrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement
8842	of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports
8843	in the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, resident in
8844	the colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all
8845	control by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a
8846	tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into
8847	the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward
8848	the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial
8849	officials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed at the
8850	tea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This
8851	law abolished the duty which the East India Company had to pay in
8852	England on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea
8853	merchants might thus find it possible to undersell American tea
8854	smugglers.
8855	
8856	=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been
8857	content with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,
8858	and neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of
8859	the Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the
8860	harsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at
8861	their posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,
8862	1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to
8863	issue "writs of assistance," empowering customs officers to enter "any
8864	house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies
8865	or plantations in America to search for and seize" prohibited or
8866	smuggled goods.
8867	
8868	The writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to
8869	revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who
8870	cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual
8871	gains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a "minion of the law"
8872	to enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much
8873	for the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for
8874	self-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to
8875	establish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.
8876	
8877	The writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent
8878	illicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that
8879	time. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which
8880	arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a
8881	Massachusetts court for writs of assistance "as usual." This application
8882	was vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a
8883	speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it
8884	away "ready to take up arms against writs of assistance." Otis denounced
8885	the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
8886	his head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the
8887	liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work
8888	possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to
8889	spread terror and desolation through the land. "What a scene," he
8890	exclaimed, "does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,
8891	or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a
8892	writ of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary
8893	exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and
8894	blood." He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament
8895	could not establish it because it was against the British constitution.
8896	This was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly
8897	echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to
8898	America to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.
8899	"Then and there," wrote John Adams, "the child Independence was born."
8900	Such was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of
8901	customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.
8902	
8903	=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's
8904	Acts were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.
8905	The assembly of New York, protesting against the "ruinous and
8906	insupportable" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the
8907	care of British troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering
8908	Act. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to
8909	obey the law. It was not until a third election was held that compliance
8910	with the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province. In the
8911	meantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their
8912	representative bodies rested.
8913	
8914	
8915	RENEWED RESISTANCE IN AMERICA
8916	
8917	=The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the
8918	leadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed
8919	intervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a
8920	Circular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies
8921	informing them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly
8922	condemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that
8923	Parliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent
8924	and that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be
8925	represented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to
8926	consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free
8927	who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and
8928	paid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other colonies,
8929	in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common
8930	predicament in which they were all placed.
8931	
8932	[Illustration: _From an old print._
8933	
8934	SAMUEL ADAMS]
8935	
8936	=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing
8937	of the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On
8938	meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and
8939	South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also
8940	dissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,
8941	passed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of
8942	imposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew
8943	the right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of
8944	persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the
8945	king for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution
8946	of the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal
8947	governor.
8948	
8949	=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities
8950	kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of
8951	citizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among
8952	the centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British
8953	goods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about
8954	the patronage of home products still more loyally.
8955	
8956	On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to
8957	jostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things
8958	went from bad to worse until some "boys and young fellows" began to
8959	throw snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the
8960	crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the
8961	"massacre," a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was
8962	sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated
8963	and tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded
8964	and ordered the regulars away.
8965	
8966	The Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.
8967	Popular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.
8968	Their defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by
8969	John Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst
8970	
8971	offenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the
8972	jury, however, Adams warned the British government against its course,
8973	saying, that "from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous
8974	town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one." Two of
8975	the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.
8976	
8977	=Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some
8978	citizens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,
8979	openly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven
8980	who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. A little later royal
8981	troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,
8982	called the "Lexington of the South."
8983	
8984	=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as
8985	well as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists
8986	broke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for
8987	smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was
8988	caught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the
8989	vessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission,
8990	sent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to
8991	account, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very
8992	appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to
8993	action; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution
8994	creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation
8995	among the colonies in resistance to British measures.
8996	
8997	=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding the
8998	Townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except
8999	that on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other
9000	commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,
9001	Parliament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the
9002	financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the
9003	Tea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to
9004	return to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on
9005	all tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be
9006	collected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down
9007	in the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the
9008	colonists.
9009	
9010	This arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the
9011	colonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one
9012	thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it
9013	promised to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of
9014	cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large
9015	stocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who
9016	were engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an
9017	irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New
9018	York, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were
9019	roughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,
9020	disguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo
9021	into the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,
9022	determined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed
9023	it.
9024	
9025	
9026	RETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
9027	
9028	=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in
9029	Boston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no
9030	soft policy in dealing with his American subjects. "The die is cast," he
9031	stated with evident satisfaction. "The colonies must either triumph or
9032	submit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very
9033	meek." Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as "the
9034	proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had
9035	the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not
9036	trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not
9037	understand." This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of
9038	Lord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.
9039	Even Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in
9040	upholding its authority.
9041	
9042	=The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,
9043	passed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five
9044	"intolerable acts." They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The
9045	_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to
9046	commerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,
9047	revoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that
9048	the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should
9049	be named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect
9050	certain officers) could not be held without the governor's consent. A
9051	_third_ measure, after denouncing the "utter subversion of all lawful
9052	government" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to
9053	Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other
9054	persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.
9055	The _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts
9056	towns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted
9057	religious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries
9058	of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western
9059	region, government by a viceroy.
9060	
9061	The intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary
9062	celerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was
9063	ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,
9064	condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and
9065	showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He
9066	was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both
9067	houses without a division, the entry "unanimous" being made upon their
9068	journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.
9069	The law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a
9070	vote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to
9071	one. The triumph of the ministry was complete. "What passed in Boston,"
9072	exclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, "is the overt act of High
9073	Treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight." The
9074	crown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.
9075	
9076	In the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To the
9077	American Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That
9078	project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct
9079	attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The
9080	British government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics
9081	either at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive
9082	in granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because
9083	Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,
9084	large claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.
9085	
9086	To enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British
9087	government was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed
9088	forces in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of
9089	Massachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King
9090	George was to give "the rebels," as he called them, a taste of strong
9091	medicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.
9092	
9093	
9094	FROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA
9095	
9096	=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the
9097	destruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies
9098	a new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with the
9099	British ministry, the Americans spoke of their "rights as Englishmen"
9100	and condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the
9101	principles of the English constitution under which they all lived. When
9102	they saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned
9103	for support to their "natural rights." The latter doctrine, in the form
9104	in which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the
9105	constitutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in
9106	defense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American
9107	leaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in
9108	the hour of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did
9109	not rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the
9110	crown. "Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things," retorted
9111	Otis when the constitutional argument failed. "A time may come when
9112	Parliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,
9113	inherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens
9114	would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished
9115	until the general conflagration." Of the same opinion was the young and
9116	impetuous Alexander Hamilton. "The sacred rights of mankind," he
9117	exclaimed, "are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
9118	records. They are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human
9119	destiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or
9120	obscured by mortal power."
9121	
9122	Firm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their
9123	rights, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they
9124	hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly
9125	avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest
9126	language against his policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalists as a
9127	firebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning
9128	concessions from England. "I argue this cause with the greater
9129	pleasure," he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of
9130	assistance, "as it is in favor of British liberty ... and as it is in
9131	opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods
9132	cost one king of England his head and another his throne."
9133	
9134	=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of
9135	American sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,
9136	Edmund Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of
9137	American democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He
9138	saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the American
9139	spirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned his countrymen that
9140	there were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only
9141	three. One was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of
9142	the colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded
9143	in the essential circumstances of American life. The second was to
9144	prosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he begged his
9145	countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that "a government
9146	against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a
9147	government to which submission is equivalent to slavery." The third and
9148	right way to meet the problem, Burke concluded, was to accept the
9149	American spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies
9150	into equal partnership.
9151	
9152	=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,
9153	was equally impossible to George III and the majority in Parliament. To
9154	their narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and American
9155	resistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their
9156	view, was to dispatch more troops to crush the "rebels"; and that very
9157	act took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:
9158	"Facts are stubborn things." Opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers
9159	were visible to the veriest street urchin. "Now," said Gouverneur
9160	Morris, "the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore."
9161	It was too late to talk about the excellence of the British
9162	constitution. If any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern
9163	historians as to why the crisis came at last, he can clarify his
9164	understanding by reading again Edmund Burke's stately oration, _On
9165	Conciliation with America_.

9248	THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION
9249	
9250	
9251	RESISTANCE AND RETALIATION
9252	
9253	=The Continental Congress.=--When the news of the "intolerable acts"
9254	reached America, every one knew what strong medicine Parliament was
9255	prepared to administer to all those who resisted its authority. The
9256	cause of Massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. Opposition
9257	to British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national
9258	character. To local committees and provincial conventions was added a
9259	Continental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts on June 17,
9260	1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons
9261	was electric. By hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected
9262	during the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in
9263	Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest men in America
9264	were there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virginia and John
9265	and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was
9266	represented. Some were impatient with mild devices; the majority favored
9267	moderation.
9268	
9269	The Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in
9270	clear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. It
9271	approved the resistance to British measures offered by Massachusetts and
9272	promised the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to
9273	King George and another to the people of England, disavowing the idea of
9274	independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British
9275	government.
9276	
9277	=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,
9278	with professions of faith and with petitions. It took one revolutionary
9279	step. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,
9280	and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local
9281	"committees of safety and inspection," to be elected by the qualified
9282	voters. The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw
9283	itself athwart British law. It made a rule to bind American citizens and
9284	to be carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within
9285	the British state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.
9286	The colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose
9287	one authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the
9288	non-importation agreement or they were against it. They either bought
9289	English goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--"May Britain
9290	be wise and America be free"--the first Continental Congress adjourned
9291	in October, having appointed the tenth of May following for the meeting
9292	of a second Congress, should necessity require.
9293	
9294	=Lord North's "Olive Branch."=--When the news of the action of the
9295	American Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal
9296	of the obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could wring from the prime
9297	minister, Lord North, was a set of "conciliatory resolutions" proposing
9298	to relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of
9299	imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of
9300	the crown. This "olive branch" was accompanied by a resolution assuring
9301	the king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by
9302	the restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the
9303	commerce of New England.
9304	
9305	=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the
9306	British authorities in Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in
9307	upholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military
9308	stores had been collected at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize
9309	them. By this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.
9310	At Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred "the little thing" that
9311	produced "the great event." An unexpected collision beyond the thought
9312	or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the
9313	battle field.
9314	
9315	=The Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war
9316	was actually at hand, the second Continental Congress, which met at
9317	Philadelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was
9318	beyond human power. It petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the
9319	colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil
9320	war. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to
9321	Lord North's offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was
9322	unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal
9323	the offensive acts of Parliament.
9324	
9325	=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America
9326	were about to present the last petition of Congress to the king on
9327	August 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamation of rebellion. This
9328	announcement declared that the colonists, "misled by dangerous and
9329	ill-designing men," were in a state of insurrection; it called on the
9330	civil and military powers to bring "the traitors to justice"; and it
9331	threatened with "condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and
9332	abettors of such traitorous designs." It closed with the usual prayer:
9333	"God, save the king." Later in the year, Parliament passed a sweeping
9334	act destroying all trade and intercourse with America. Congress was
9335	silent at last. Force was also America's answer.
9336	
9337	
9338	AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE
9339	
9340	=Drifting into War.=--Although the Congress had not given up all hope of
9341	reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved
9342	to defend American rights by arms if necessary. It transformed the
9343	militiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the battle of Lexington,
9344	into a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.
9345	It assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wage
9346	war, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.
9347	
9348	[Illustration: _From an old print_
9349	
9350	SPIRIT OF 1776]
9351	
9352	Events followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by
9353	the stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British
9354	regulars pay dearly for all they got. On July 3, Washington took command
9355	of the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments
9356	in drumming up recruits for its army in England, Scotland, and Ireland,
9357	the British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of
9358	Hesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands
9359	of soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insult to
9360	America. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides
9361	of the water. Such was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative
9362	historian Lecky: "The conduct of England in hiring German mercenaries to
9363	subdue the essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made
9364	reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable." The news of this
9365	wretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America
9366	before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that Washington
9367	had taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to sail with
9368	his entire army for Halifax.
9369	
9370	=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were
9371	bearing the Americans away from their old position under the British
9372	constitution toward a final separation. Slowly and against their
9373	desires, prudent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united
9374	them to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of
9375	revolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. In
9376	all parts of the country and among all classes, the question of the hour
9377	was being debated. "American independence," as the historian Bancroft
9378	says, "was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one
9379	assembly. It had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers
9380	and merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the
9381	coast and the backwoodsmen of the West; in town meetings and from the
9382	pulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county
9383	conventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and
9384	assemblies."
9385	
9386	[Illustration: _From an old print_
9387	
9388	THOMAS PAINE]
9389	
9390	=Paine's "Commonsense."=--In the midst of this ferment of American
9391	opinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating
9392	public with a program for absolute independence, without fears and
9393	without apologies. In the early days of 1776, Thomas Paine issued the
9394	first of his famous tracts, "Commonsense," a passionate attack upon the
9395	British monarchy and an equally passionate plea for American liberty.
9396	Casting aside the language of petition with which Americans had hitherto
9397	addressed George III, Paine went to the other extreme and assailed him
9398	with many a violent epithet. He condemned monarchy itself as a system
9399	which had laid the world "in blood and ashes." Instead of praising the
9400	British constitution under which colonists had been claiming their
9401	rights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was "owing
9402	to the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the
9403	government, that the Crown is not as oppressive in England as in
9404	Turkey."
9405	
9406	Having thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old
9407	order, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
9408	separation from Great Britain. There was nothing in the sphere of
9409	practical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the
9410	mother country. Allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars
9411	in which they had been involved. Reasons of trade were not less weighty
9412	in behalf of independence. "Our corn will fetch its price in any market
9413	in Europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we
9414	will." As to matters of government, "it is not in the power of Britain
9415	to do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too
9416	weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of
9417	convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us."
9418	
9419	There is accordingly no alternative to independence for America.
9420	"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of
9421	the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...
9422	Arms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the
9423	choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The
9424	sun never shone on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a
9425	city, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'Tis not
9426	the concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the
9427	contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the
9428	proceedings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and
9429	honor.... O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose not only the
9430	tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be
9431	extinct. Let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen,
9432	an open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of
9433	mankind and of the free and independent states of America." As more than
9434	100,000 copies were scattered broadcast over the country, patriots
9435	exclaimed with Washington: "Sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!"
9436	
9437	=The Drift of Events toward Independence.=--Official support for the
9438	idea of independence began to come from many quarters. On the tenth of
9439	February, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,
9440	advocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence
9441	for all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way
9442	by abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a
9443	complete plan of self-government. A month later, on April 12, the
9444	neighboring state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which
9445	others shrank. It empowered its representatives in the Congress to
9446	concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring
9447	independence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly
9448	responded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May
9449	15, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia to propose the independence
9450	of the United Colonies and to give the assent of Virginia to the act of
9451	separation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the
9452	state house was lowered for all time.
9453	
9454	Meanwhile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events
9455	outside. The subject of independence was constantly being raised. "Are
9456	we rebels?" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.
9457	"No: we must declare ourselves a free people." Others hesitated and
9458	spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. "Is
9459	not America already independent?" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.
9460	"Why not then declare it?" Still there was uncertainty and delegates
9461	avoided the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last, on May 10,
9462	Congress declared that the authority of the British crown in America
9463	must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of
9464	their own.
9465	
9466	[Illustration: _From an old print_
9467	
9468	THOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF
9469	INDEPENDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS]
9470	
9471	=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,
9472	on June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Congress moved that "these
9473	united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent
9474	states." A committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal
9475	document setting forth the reasons for the act, and on July 2 all the
9476	states save New York went on record in favor of severing their political
9477	connection with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4, Jefferson's draft
9478	of the Declaration of Independence, changed in some slight particulars,
9479	was adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang
9480	out the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost
9481	hamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will to have a place among
9482	the powers of the world.
9483	
9484	To some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence
9485	is one of them. American patriotism is forever associated with it; but
9486	patriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vigor of
9487	its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in
9488	the records of time. The secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact
9489	that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political
9490	ideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading
9491	throughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down
9492	thrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on
9493	battle fields as far apart as Marston Moor and Chateau-Thierry. That
9494	ideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple
9495	sentence: "Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
9496	governed."
9497	
9498	Written in a "decent respect for the opinions of mankind," to set forth
9499	the causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from
9500	Britain, the Declaration contained a long list of "abuses and
9501	usurpations" which had induced them to throw off the government of King
9502	George. That section of the Declaration has passed into "ancient"
9503	history and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new basis for
9504	government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a
9505	household phrase in the Old World as in the New.
9506	
9507	In the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,
9508	from the standpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of
9509	revolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their
9510	Creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the
9511	pursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these
9512	rights; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
9513	governed; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
9514	these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and
9515	institute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and
9516	organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to
9517	effect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic
9518	drama of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every
9519	privilege not founded on popular assent.
9520	
9521	
9522	THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE NEW ALLEGIANCE
9523	
9524	=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into
9525	armed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their
9526	forces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, for
9527	the means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and
9528	committees of correspondence. The working tools of the Revolution were
9529	in fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial
9530	groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment.
9531	As early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in Boston
9532	under the leadership of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent
9533	emissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of education
9534	in the doctrines of liberty.
9535	
9536	[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA AT THE TIME OF THE
9537	DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE]
9538	
9539	Upon local organizations similar in character to the Boston committee
9540	were built county committees and then the larger colonial committees,
9541	congresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the
9542	revolutionary elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely
9543	the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and
9544	controlled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was
9545	built the Continental Congress, the precursor of union under the
9546	Articles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of the
9547	United States. This was the revolutionary government set up within the
9548	British empire in America.
9549	
9550	=State Constitutions Framed.=--With the rise of these new assemblies of
9551	the people, the old colonial governments broke down. From the royal
9552	provinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,
9553	and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities. The appeal to
9554	the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for
9555	themselves, issued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.
9556	Before the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
9557	Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions
9558	as states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. Connecticut and
9559	Rhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their
9560	needs, merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as
9561	before so far as the form of government was concerned. South Carolina,
9562	which had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more
9563	complete constitution in 1778. Two years later Massachusetts with much
9564	deliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its
9565	essential features remains unchanged to-day.
9566	
9567	The new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial
9568	models. For the royal governor was substituted a governor or president
9569	chosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, New York and
9570	Massachusetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was
9571	substituted, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or
9572	assembly, was continued virtually without change. The old property
9573	restriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was
9574	continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus
9575	deprived of the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several
9576	constitutions, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated
9577	that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical
9578	experiments in democracy. The protests of a few women, like Mrs. John
9579	Adams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, against a
9580	government which excluded them from political rights were treated as
9581	mild curiosities of no significance, although in New Jersey women were
9582	allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.
9583	
9584	By the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of
9585	authority derived from any source save "the people," were swept aside
9586	and republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first
9587	time to the modern world. Copies of these remarkable documents prepared
9588	by plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in
9589	Europe. There they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to
9590	a generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the
9591	democratic revolution in the Old World.
9592	
9593	=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions
9594	was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. They had only to build
9595	on foundations already laid. The establishment of a national system of
9596	government was another matter. There had always been, it must be
9597	remembered, a system of central control over the colonies, but Americans
9598	had had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the
9599	crown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,
9600	accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for
9601	action on a national stage.
9602	
9603	Many forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of
9604	national destiny. There were differences in economic interest--commerce
9605	and industry in the North and the planting system of the South. There
9606	were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops
9607	for common defense. To these practical difficulties were added local
9608	pride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their
9609	provincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon
9610	the common enterprise.
9611	
9612	Nevertheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of
9613	federation. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work
9614	before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a
9615	permanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress resolved to go
9616	into a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,
9617	undaunted by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty years before, again
9618	presented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed
9619	and it was not until late in 1777 that Congress presented to the states
9620	the Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealousies delayed
9621	ratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the
9622	surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the last of the
9623	states, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all
9624	that could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a
9625	chief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simply a
9626	Congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it
9627	the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of
9628	government--money and soldiers.
9629	
9630	=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successive steps were
9631	taken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised
9632	and applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against
9633	the new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental
9634	Congress agreed not to allow the importation of British goods, it
9635	provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. Such
9636	agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all
9637	opponents being excluded from the elections. Before these bodies those
9638	who persisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or
9639	punished according to circumstances. As soon as the new state
9640	constitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the
9641	same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of
9642	the new order of things.
9643	
9644	[Illustration: MOBBING THE TORIES]
9645	
9646	These patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,
9647	were sometimes ruthless in their methods. They called upon all men to
9648	sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the "association test."
9649	Those who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the
9650	more dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at
9651	one time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New
9652	York. Thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. The
9653	black-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred
9654	persons of prominence who were under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who
9655	were bold enough to speak and write against the Revolution were
9656	suppressed and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in
9657	the North, the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the
9658	proceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.
9659	
9660	The work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was
9661	sometimes supplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hanged without
9662	trial, and others were tarred and feathered. One was placed upon a cake
9663	of ice and held there "until his loyalty to King George might cool."
9664	Whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best
9665	they could within the British lines or into Canada, where the British
9666	government gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,
9667	but they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well
9668	as a war for independence, was being waged.
9669	
9670	=The Patriots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or another, those who
9671	were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who
9672	preferred to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the
9673	Americans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the
9674	British monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution
9675	was not submitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have
9676	conflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the testimony of a
9677	careful and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds
9678	of the people were for the American cause and not more than one-third
9679	opposed the Revolution at all stages.
9680	
9681	On behalf of the loyalists, or Tories as they were popularly known,
9682	extravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of
9683	the first Continental Congress and had fled to England when he saw its
9684	temper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 that not
9685	one-fifth of the American people supported the insurrection and that
9686	"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with Great
9687	Britain upon constitutional principles to independence." At the same
9688	time General Robertson, who had lived in America twenty-four years,
9689	declared that "more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the
9690	king's government to the Congress' tyranny." In an address to the king
9691	in that year a committee of American loyalists asserted that "the number
9692	of Americans in his Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops
9693	enlisted by Congress to oppose them."
9694	
9695	=The Character of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,
9696	more than a thousand people fled with him. This great company, according
9697	to a careful historian, "formed the aristocracy of the province by
9698	virtue of their official rank; of their dignified callings and
9699	professions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture." The act
9700	of banishment passed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,
9701	"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of
9702	New England," more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard
9703	College. The same was true of New York and Philadelphia; namely, that
9704	the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,
9705	clergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion the loyalists fought
9706	against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees
9707	for a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.
9708	
9709	=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in America joined
9710	the British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal
9711	cause. Those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in
9712	editorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They declared
9713	that the members of Congress were "obscure, pettifogging attorneys,
9714	bankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc." The people and their
9715	leaders they characterized as "wretched banditti ... the refuse and
9716	dregs of mankind." The generals in the army they sneered at as "men of
9717	rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress."
9718	
9719	=Patriot Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,
9720	patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public
9721	opinion favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat
9722	the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the
9723	war. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Montgomery in the
9724	winter of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada into the revolution--a
9725	disaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed Washington in
9726	1776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and
9727	beaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. These reverses were almost
9728	too great for the stoutest patriots.
9729	
9730	Pamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs
9731	of the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,
9732	forsook the classroom for the field of political controversy. The poet,
9733	Philip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tories and celebrated
9734	the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,
9735	and satires flowed from the press in an unending stream. Fast days,
9736	battle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress
9737	afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.
9738	"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?" anxiously inquired John
9739	Adams in a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. "The clergy of
9740	every denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten
9741	every Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God
9742	most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. They pray
9743	for the American army."
9744	
9745	Thomas Paine never let his pen rest. He had been with the forces of
9746	Washington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New
9747	Jersey into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of such reverses on the
9748	army as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he made a second great
9749	appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, "The Crisis," the first part
9750	of which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. This
9751	tract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. "These are the
9752	times that try men's souls," he opened. "The summer soldier and the
9753	sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his
9754	country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
9755	and women." Paine laid his lash fiercely on the Tories, branding every
9756	one as a coward grounded in "servile, slavish, self-interested fear." He
9757	deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. He
9758	refuted the charge that the retreat through New Jersey was a disaster
9759	and he promised victory soon. "By perseverance and fortitude," he
9760	concluded, "we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and
9761	submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a
9762	depopulated city, habitations without safety and slavery without
9763	hope.... Look on this picture and weep over it." His ringing call to
9764	arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was
9765	over.
9766	
9767	
9768	MILITARY AFFAIRS
9769	
9770	=The Two Phases of the War.=--The war which opened with the battle of
9771	Lexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of
9772	Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct
9773	phases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with France, in
9774	1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During the first
9775	phase, the war was confined mainly to the North. The outstanding
9776	features of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the British,
9777	the expulsion of American forces from New York and their retreat through
9778	New Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia by the
9779	British (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his
9780	capture at Saratoga in October, 1777, and the encampment of American
9781	forces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.
9782	
9783	The final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with
9784	France on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the Middle states,
9785	the West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events
9786	were the withdrawal of the British from Philadelphia, the battle of
9787	Monmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying
9788	American forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the
9789	West, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into the Illinois
9790	country, secured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the
9791	country between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South, the second
9792	period opened with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,
9793	conquered Georgia, and restored the royal governor. In 1780 they seized
9794	Charleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American forces under
9795	Gates at Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at
9796	Cowpens and King's Mountain. Then came the closing scenes. Cornwallis
9797	began the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into
9798	North Carolina, clashed with him at Guilford Court House, retired to the
9799	coast, took charge of British forces engaged in plundering Virginia, and
9800	fortified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the
9801	sea and the combined French and American forces on land.
9802	
9803	=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of
9804	the war offered many problems. From first to last it extended from
9805	Massachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. It was
9806	nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though
9807	the British navy kept the channel open, transports were constantly
9808	falling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The
9809	sea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportation between
9810	points along the coast and gave ready access to the American centers of
9811	wealth and population. Of this the British made good use. Though early
9812	forced to give up Boston, they seized New York and kept it until the end
9813	of the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by
9814	the approach of the French fleet; and they captured and held both
9815	Savannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest
9816	of cities.
9817	
9818	Particularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small
9819	portion of the American people lived in towns. Countrymen back from the
9820	coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They lived on
9821	the produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact
9822	gave strength to them in the contest. Whenever the British ventured far
9823	from the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced
9824	to surrender at Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his
9825	base of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Charleston, they
9826	were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,
9827	and Pickens. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene at Guilford far
9828	in the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.
9829	Sustained by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their
9830	armies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the
9831	Americans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell
9832	blow.
9833	
9834	=The Sea Power.=--The British made good use of their fleet in cutting
9835	off American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the
9836	United States. As an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was
9837	not such a vital matter. All the materials for a comfortable though
9838	somewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference to a
9839	nation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were
9840	cut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.
9841	
9842	Nor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry
9843	materially change the situation. They demonstrated the skill of American
9844	seamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of
9845	British marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the
9846	seas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the
9847	hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled British supply
9848	ships and kept British merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until the
9849	French fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to
9850	reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the
9851	possibilities of a maritime disaster.
9852	
9853	=Commanding Officers.=--On the score of military leadership it is
9854	difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.
9855	There is no doubt that all the British commanders were men of experience
9856	in the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had served in America during the
9857	French War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict
9858	disciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,
9859	society, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to
9860	overwhelm Washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at New York
9861	and Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. John
9862	Burgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from
9863	Canada, had likewise seen service in the French War both in America and
9864	Europe. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and
9865	after the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,
9866	he devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who
9867	directed the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,
9868	had "learned his trade on the continent," and was regarded as a man of
9869	discretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose
9870	achievements at Camden and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at
9871	Yorktown, had seen service in the Seven Years' War and had undoubted
9872	talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in
9873	India. Though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,
9874	they all had training and experience to guide them.
9875	
9876	[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]
9877	
9878	The Americans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been
9879	interested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire
9880	during the first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He
9881	had no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of
9882	the British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. He
9883	was reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or
9884	depression at reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolution, "what held
9885	the patriot forces together?" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John
9886	Marshall_. Then he answers: "George Washington and he alone. Had he
9887	died or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended....
9888	Washington was the soul of the American cause. Washington was the
9889	government. Washington was the Revolution." The weakness of Congress in
9890	furnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at
9891	ease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers against him
9892	such as the "Conway cabal," the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even the
9893	treason of Benedict Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his
9894	breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did
9895	not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through
9896	to the bitter end. The weight of Washington's moral force was
9897	immeasurable.
9898	
9899	Of the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have
9900	been experienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the
9901	unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book
9902	seller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called
9903	him to battle. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a "seasoned soldier"
9904	because he had entered the British army as a youth, had been wounded at
9905	Braddock's memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven
9906	Years' War; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the Revolution.
9907	The triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing
9908	defeat at Camden put an end to his military pretensions. Nathanael
9909	Greene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without military experience
9910	who, when convinced that war was coming, read Caesar's _Commentaries_ and
9911	took up the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and modest planter of South
9912	Carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush
9913	with the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the
9914	heroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Braddock's army and had seen
9915	some fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military
9916	knowledge, from the point of view of a trained British officer, was
9917	negligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New
9918	Hampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to
9919	lay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne was a
9920	Pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,
9921	read a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for
9922	service. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders, and
9923	it is typical of them all. Some had seen fighting with the French and
9924	Indians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular
9925	troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in European
9926	experience. Courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of
9927	the country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought
9928	during the Revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the
9929	balance.
9930	
9931	=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius was added
9932	military talent from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in
9933	the iron regime of Frederick the Great, came over from Prussia, joined
9934	Washington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the
9935	men, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular
9936	soldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De Kalb, from
9937	Poland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war
9938	as waged in Europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.
9939	Lafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by
9940	several officers of wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the
9941	war sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell at the
9942	siege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American
9943	war to defend in vain the independence of his native land. To these
9944	distinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American
9945	revolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which
9946	fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military
9947	power of the first rank.
9948	
9949	=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their
9950	annals are short and simple. The regulars from the standing army who
9951	were sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up
9952	by special efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought
9953	outright by King George presented few problems of management to the
9954	British officers. These common soldiers were far away from home and
9955	enlisted for the war. Nearly all of them were well disciplined and many
9956	of them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King George
9957	fought bravely, as the records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth
9958	demonstrate. Many a man and subordinate officer and, for that matter,
9959	some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against
9960	their own kin; but they obeyed orders.
9961	
9962	The Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim
9963	determination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in
9964	discipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war broke
9965	in upon them, there were no common preparations for it. There was no
9966	continental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of
9967	them experienced in fighting but few of them "regulars" in the military
9968	sense. Moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,
9969	unaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints
9970	imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. They were continually
9971	leaving the service just at the most critical moments. "The militia,"
9972	lamented Washington, "come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell
9973	where; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at
9974	last at a critical moment."
9975	
9976	Again and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of
9977	regulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to
9978	some definite plan. At last he was able to overcome, in part at least,
9979	the chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that
9980	reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a
9981	bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this
9982	scheme, which Washington regarded as far short of justice to the
9983	soldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the close of the
9984	conflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of
9985	meeting British regulars on equal terms.
9986	
9987	Though there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and
9988	effective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny the
9989	time-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
9990	forces of regulars in a seven years' war for independence. They did
9991	nothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,
9992	and Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White
9993	Plains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen
9994	overcome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.
9995	"To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier," wrote
9996	Washington, "requires time.... To expect the same service from raw and
9997	undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never
9998	did and perhaps never will happen."
9999	
10000	=How the War Was Won.=--Then how did the American army win the war? For
10001	one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the British
10002	generals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with
10003	large bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing
10004	paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American
10005	army. "Nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved
10006	us," solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is fair to say that
10007	this apparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The
10008	ministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were
10009	loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a
10010	war vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously
10011	better than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the
10012	healing. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were
10013	thrown into the scale, the Americans themselves had learned many things
10014	about the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were
10015	embarrassed by the problem of supplies. Their troops could not forage
10016	with the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. The
10017	long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the
10018	warships of France joined the American privateers in preying on supply
10019	boats.
10020	
10021	The British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and
10022	outdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and
10023	Yorktown. Stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army, which
10024	could be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue
10025	the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.
10026	They learned also that America would then be alienated, fretful, and the
10027	scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a
10028	price which staggered even Lord North and George III. Moreover, there
10029	were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.
10030	
10031	=Women and the War.=--At no time were the women of America indifferent
10032	to the struggle for independence. When it was confined to the realm of
10033	opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth
10034	Timothee, for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to
10035	espouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James
10036	Otis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case
10037	upon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the
10038	leaders to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing
10039	about with uncertainty at the Continental Congress, his wife was writing
10040	letters to him declaring her faith in "independency."
10041	
10042	When the war came down upon the country, women helped in every field. In
10043	sustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren with a
10044	tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.
10045	Almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered
10046	service in the "second line of defense." Mrs. Washington managed the
10047	plantation while the General was at the front and went north to face the
10048	rigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to her
10049	husband and his men. The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah
10050	Bache, while her father was pleading the American cause in France, set
10051	the women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even
10052	near the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling
10053	powder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their
10054	lives.
10055	
10056	In the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested
10057	crops without enjoying the picturesque title of "farmerettes" and they
10058	canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their
10059	labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: "Immediately on being cut
10060	off from the use of English manufactures, the women engaged within their
10061	own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.
10062	They thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their
10063	labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for
10064	themselves. In this way the female part of families by their industry
10065	and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,
10066	evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their
10067	service."
10068	
10069	For their war work, women were commended by high authorities on more
10070	than one occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even
10071	as in our own day. Washington thanked them for their labors and paid
10072	tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had
10073	given to the cause of independence.
10074	
10075	
10076	THE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION
10077	
10078	When the Revolution opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in
10079	America but no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was
10080	in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Having no authority
10081	to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the
10082	provincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to
10083	finance the war. "Do you think," boldly inquired one of the delegates,
10084	"that I will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send
10085	to the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will
10086	pay for the whole?"
10087	
10088	=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appealing political
10089	economy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of
10090	credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective
10091	populations. Other issues followed in quick succession. In all about
10092	$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several
10093	states added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then came
10094	interest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions
10095	were also borrowed from France and small sums from Holland and Spain. In
10096	desperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. The
10097	property of Tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about
10098	$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the states asking them to
10099	raise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened
10100	with their own affairs, gave little heed.
10101	
10102	=Inflation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it
10103	rapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth
10104	only two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by
10105	Congress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face
10106	value; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.
10107	Speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the
10108	republic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public
10109	securities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley
10110	Forge. "Speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling," exclaimed
10111	Washington, "afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public
10112	virtue. Nothing, I am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency
10113	... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of
10114	the enemy."
10115	
10116	=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the
10117	war were added the labors of private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant
10118	of Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, including Madison,
10119	Jefferson, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with
10120	money for their daily needs. All together he contributed the huge sum of
10121	half a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,
10122	if not in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Another Philadelphia
10123	merchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the "patriot
10124	financier" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet
10125	the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. When his own
10126	funds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the
10127	handling of merchandise, he created agencies at important points to
10128	distribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as
10129	well as financial talents.
10130	
10131	[Illustration: ROBERT MORRIS]
10132	
10133	Women organized "drives" for money, contributed their plate and their
10134	jewels, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in
10135	return for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without
10136	yielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,
10137	the issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,
10138	borrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the Congress
10139	staggered through the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his
10140	next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a
10141	kindly fate.
10142	
10143	
10144	THE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION
10145	
10146	When the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and
10147	their commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and
10148	supplies, the writers who sustained the American spirit, and the women
10149	who did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the
10150	achievements of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was
10151	keenly appreciated by the leaders in the Continental Congress. They were
10152	fairly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of
10153	power and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their
10154	rulers. All this information they turned to good account, in opening
10155	relations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and
10156	even military assistance. For the transaction of this delicate business,
10157	they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as
10158	1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.
10159	
10160	=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a
10161	friendly ear to the American cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a
10162	commissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, often styled the
10163	"first American diplomat." Later in the year a form of treaty to be
10164	presented to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and
10165	Deane were selected as American representatives at the court of "His
10166	Most Christian Majesty the King of France." John Jay of New York was
10167	chosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to Holland the
10168	same year; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and
10169	Berlin. The representative selected for St. Petersburg spent two
10170	fruitless years there, "ignored by the court, living in obscurity and
10171	experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure." Frederick the Great,
10172	king of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a market for
10173	Silesian linens and woolens, but, fearing England's command of the sea,
10174	he refused to give direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.
10175	
10176	=Early French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution
10177	was won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion,
10178	although many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis
10179	XVI's foreign minister, Count de Vergennes, before the arrival of any
10180	American representative, had brought to the attention of the king the
10181	opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her
10182	colonies. He showed him how France could redress her grievances and
10183	"reduce the power and greatness of England"--the empire that in 1763 had
10184	forced upon her a humiliating peace "at the price of our possessions,
10185	of our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,
10186	Louisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal." Equally successful in
10187	gaining the king's interest was a curious French adventurer,
10188	Beaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two
10189	popular plays, "Figaro" and "The Barber of Seville." These two men had
10190	already urged upon the king secret aid for America before Deane appeared
10191	on the scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential
10192	arrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to
10193	the struggling colonies, although official requests for them were
10194	officially refused by the French government.
10195	
10196	=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only
10197	in private by the king's minister, Vergennes. The French people,
10198	however, made manifest their affection for the "plain republican" in
10199	"his full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet." He was known among
10200	men of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of
10201	extraordinary ability. His "Poor Richard" had thrice been translated
10202	into French and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the
10203	kingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,
10204	peasants, and stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished him success in
10205	his mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose her head in a
10206	revolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging "our dear
10207	republican."
10208	
10209	For the king of France, however, this was more serious business. England
10210	resented the presence of this "traitor" in Paris, and Louis had to be
10211	cautious about plunging into another war that might also end
10212	disastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin's sojourn in Paris
10213	was a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington's brilliant
10214	exploit at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and the battle with
10215	Cornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,
10216	the loss of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, and the retirement
10217	to Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York City and
10218	Philadelphia--two strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson
10219	and Delaware rivers were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his British
10220	troops was on his way down through the heart of northern New York,
10221	cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. No wonder the
10222	king was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed in
10223	from all sides by the American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging
10224	parties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on October 17,
10225	1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to
10226	receive the honor.
10227	
10228	=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,
10229	placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,
10230	reached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends
10231	sat gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once
10232	the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles with
10233	such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and
10234	his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the
10235	Revolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed
10236	in February, 1778. The independence of the United States was recognized
10237	by France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.
10238	Combined military action was agreed upon and Louis then formally
10239	declared war on England. Men who had, a few short years before, fought
10240	one another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of
10241	Abraham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the Empire that Pitt
10242	had erected and that George III was pulling down.
10243	
10244	=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remembering
10245	the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada and
10246	hoping to drive the British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the
10247	concert of nations against England. Holland, a member of a league of
10248	armed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high
10249	seas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of Spain, France, and
10250	America to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England
10251	was added the danger of a possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit
10252	of independence was flaming up.
10253	
10254	=The British Offer Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists about to be
10255	joined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord North
10256	proposed, in February, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn
10257	enactment, Parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right
10258	of imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized
10259	the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to America.
10260	A truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable laws
10261	suspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the
10262	opening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. It was too late. Events
10263	had taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British
10264	commissioners and diplomats.
10265	
10266	=Effects of French Aid.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,
10267	large sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable
10268	body of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this
10269	help, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. The British
10270	evacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and
10271	Washington's troops were encouraged to come out of Valley Forge. They
10272	inflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but the treasonable
10273	conduct of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of
10274	Philadelphia was offset by the treason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of
10275	Savannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.
10276	
10277	The full effect of the French alliance was not felt until 1781, when
10278	Cornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Accompanied by
10279	French troops Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British
10280	to the shore while a powerful French fleet shut off their escape by sea.
10281	It was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed
10282	without French aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring British
10283	dominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown that
10284	caused Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: "It is all over! It is
10285	all over!" What might have been done without the French alliance lies
10286	hidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French
10287	soldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the
10288	earth. "All the world agree," exultantly wrote Franklin from Paris to
10289	General Washington, "that no expedition was ever better planned or
10290	better executed. It brightens the glory that must accompany your name to
10291	the latest posterity." Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its
10292	reward.
10293	
10294	
10295	PEACE AT LAST
10296	
10297	=British Opposition to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to
10298	the final discomfiture of King George and Lord North, it is necessary to
10299	remember that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home
10300	faced a powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. There were
10301	vigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated
10302	the unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,
10303	and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the
10304	American dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered
10305	against the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land.
10306	William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of American
10307	independence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in
10308	American resistance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteries against
10309	every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while
10310	giving independence to America, would work for reconciliation rather
10311	than estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his generous
10312	sympathy and warmly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of
10313	statesmen there were stout friends of the American cause like David
10314	Hume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author
10315	of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage Washington in
10316	seeing it through.
10317	
10318	Against this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole army
10319	of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and
10320	their friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it employed in this business,
10321	was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets
10322	before printing them. Far more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in
10323	time to win fame as the historian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman
10324	Empire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a
10325	lucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his
10326	friends to ridicule him in these lines:
10327	
10328	    "King George, in a fright
10329	     Lest Gibbon should write
10330	       The story of England's disgrace,
10331	     Thought no way so sure
10332	     His pen to secure
10333	       As to give the historian a place."
10334	
10335	=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side
10336	of the opponents of the government's measures. They had predicted that
10337	conquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace
10338	which would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.
10339	Every day's news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their
10340	arguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve
10341	English burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses
10342	were daily increasing. Trade with the colonies, the greatest single
10343	outlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due
10344	British merchants in America were not only unpaid but postponed into an
10345	indefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The French
10346	had a dangerous fleet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in
10347	December, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a
10348	peace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and on
10349	February 27, 1782, in the House of Commons was carried an address to the
10350	throne against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barre,
10351	and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North
10352	gave notice then that his ministry was at an end. The king moaned:
10353	"Necessity made me yield."
10354	
10355	In April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English government that
10356	it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This
10357	was embarrassing. In the treaty of alliance with France, the United
10358	States had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by
10359	both nations in open conference. Finding France, however, opposed to
10360	some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the American
10361	commissioners conferred with the British agents at Paris without
10362	consulting the French minister. They actually signed a preliminary peace
10363	draft before they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes
10364	reproached him, Franklin replied that they "had been guilty of
10365	neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work
10366	would not be ruined by a single indiscretion."
10367	
10368	=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783
10369	was a triumph for America. England recognized the independence of the
10370	United States, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundaries
10371	extending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes
10372	to the Floridas. England held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West Indies
10373	intact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.
10374	Spain won Florida and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France
10375	gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing England humbled
10376	and the colonies independent.
10377	
10378	The generous terms secured by the American commission at Paris called
10379	forth surprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way
10380	for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country. At the
10381	same time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. "This federal
10382	republic is born a pigmy," wrote the Spanish ambassador to his royal
10383	master. "A day will come when it will be a giant; even a colossus
10384	formidable to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility
10385	for establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as the
10386	advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans
10387	from all the nations. In a few years we shall watch with grief the
10388	tyrannical existence of the same colossus."

10392	
10393	SUMMARY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD
10394	
10395	The independence of the American colonies was foreseen by many European
10396	statesmen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and
10397	power; but no one could fix the hour of the great event. Until 1763 the
10398	American colonists lived fairly happily under British dominion. There
10399	were collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed
10400	with stiff-necked colonial legislatures. There were protests against the
10401	exercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on
10402	the whole, the relations between America and the mother country were
10403	more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the Stuart regime which
10404	closed in 1688.
10405	
10406	The crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was
10407	the product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.
10408	Three years before, there had come to the throne George III, a young,
10409	proud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his
10410	predecessors, Germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed
10411	things to drift in England and America. George III decided that he would
10412	be king in fact as well as in name. About the same time England brought
10413	to a close the long and costly French and Indian War and was staggering
10414	under a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly
10415	in defense of the American colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable
10416	to English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of
10417	the cost of their own defense. At this juncture there came into
10418	prominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing America and
10419	controlling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,
10420	the English taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and
10421	statesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set
10422	out upon a new course. She imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated
10423	their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. This
10424	action evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act
10425	Congress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of
10426	grievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,
10427	sacked the houses of the king's officers, and tore up the stamped paper.
10428	
10429	Frightened by uprising, the English government drew back and repealed
10430	the Stamp Act. Then it veered again and renewed its policy of
10431	interference. Interference again called forth American protests.
10432	Protests aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent
10433	over to keep order. More irritating laws were passed by Parliament.
10434	Rioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and
10435	seized in the harbor of Charleston. The British answer was more force.
10436	The response of the colonists was a Continental Congress for defense. An
10437	unexpected and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the
10438	spring of 1775 brought forth from the king of England a proclamation:
10439	"The Americans are rebels!"
10440	
10441	The die was cast. The American Revolution had begun. Washington was made
10442	commander-in-chief. Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge
10443	volume of paper currency was issued, and foreign aid was summoned.
10444	Franklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1778 he induced
10445	France to throw her sword into the balance. Three years later,
10446	Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 1783, by the formal treaty of
10447	peace, George III acknowledged the independence of the United States.
10448	The new nation, endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the
10449	Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, began its career among the
10450	sovereign powers of the earth.
10451	
10452	In the sphere of civil government, the results of the Revolution were
10453	equally remarkable. Royal officers and royal authorities were driven
10454	from the former dominions. All power was declared to be in the people.
10455	All the colonies became states, each with its own constitution or plan
10456	of government. The thirteen states were united in common bonds under the
10457	Articles of Confederation. A republic on a large scale was instituted.
10458	Thus there was begun an adventure in popular government such as the
10459	world had never seen. Could it succeed or was it destined to break down
10460	and be supplanted by a monarchy? The fate of whole continents hung upon
10461	the answer.

10563	
10564	THE FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
10565	
10566	
10567	THE PROMISE AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF AMERICA
10568	
10569	The rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states, each governed
10570	by officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by "the plain
10571	people," was the most significant feature of the eighteenth century. The
10572	majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this
10573	possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. Those
10574	Americans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that
10575	the Declaration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper
10576	constitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm "uninstructed by experience,"
10577	could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All
10578	around them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the
10579	immediate future.
10580	
10581	=The Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=--The government under
10582	the Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources
10583	necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.
10584	The sole organ of government was a Congress composed of from two to
10585	seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and
10586	paid by the state. In determining all questions, each state had one
10587	vote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no
10588	president to enforce the laws. Congress was given power to select a
10589	committee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body
10590	when it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved
10591	a failure. There was no system of national courts to which citizens and
10592	states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which
10593	they could compel obedience to law. The two great powers of government,
10594	military and financial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, could
10595	authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment
10596	of contributions to meet its bills. It could also order the
10597	establishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply
10598	their respective quotas of soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring
10599	any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. It
10600	could act only through the medium of the state governments.
10601	
10602	=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=--In the field of public finance,
10603	the disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was
10604	still outstanding. Congress was unable to pay either the interest or the
10605	principal. Public creditors were in despair, as the market value of
10606	their bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The
10607	current bills of Congress were unpaid. As some one complained, there was
10608	not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record
10609	the transactions of the shadow legislature. The currency was in utter
10610	chaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congress had become mere
10611	trash worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression
10612	of contempt so forceful as the popular saying: "not worth a
10613	Continental." To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring
10614	new streams of paper money from the press. Almost the only good money in
10615	circulation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coins, and the
10616	public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy
10617	clipping and filing away the metal. Foreign commerce was unsettled. The
10618	entire British system of trade discrimination was turned against the
10619	Americans, and Congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,
10620	was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.
10621	Domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which
10622	erected tariff barriers against their neighbors. The condition of the
10623	currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,
10624	as if to increase the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering
10625	the prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which
10626	nothing but a national system of courts could cure.
10627	
10628	=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naught by the states, the
10629	laws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the
10630	Congress of the United States fell into utter disrepute. It called upon
10631	the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be
10632	treated with contempt. Even its own members looked upon it as a solemn
10633	futility. Some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and
10634	many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.
10635	Again and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction
10636	of business.
10637	
10638	=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governments, free to
10639	pursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as
10640	many difficulties as the Congress. They too were loaded with
10641	revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive
10642	population. Oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the
10643	fall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of
10644	several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their
10645	legislatures to issue large sums of paper money. The currency fell in
10646	value, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square
10647	old accounts.
10648	
10649	In every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.
10650	Laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the
10651	third year. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were
10652	canceled by its successor. Uncertainty and distrust were the natural
10653	consequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid
10654	states to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in
10655	payment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men heavily
10656	in debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against
10657	creditors.
10658	
10659	So great did the discontent of the farmers in New Hampshire become in
10660	1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the
10661	taxes and the issuance of paper money. It was with difficulty that an
10662	armed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malcontents, under the
10663	leadership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,
10664	organized that same year open resistance to the government of the state.
10665	Shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in
10666	foreclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the
10667	lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the
10668	senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the
10669	towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and
10670	against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized
10671	the towns of Worcester and Springfield and broke up the courts of
10672	justice. All through the western part of the state the revolt spread,
10673	sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young
10674	republic. Only by the most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin able to
10675	quell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state
10676	government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had
10677	so many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of the
10678	legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents
10679	were defeated at the ensuing election. The need of national assistance
10680	for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere
10681	emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.
10682	
10683	=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,
10684	watching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that
10685	the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was
10686	careening into anarchy. "The facts of our peace and independence," wrote
10687	a friend of Washington, "do not at present wear so promising an
10688	appearance as I had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,
10689	jealousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my
10690	confidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to
10691	think that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for
10692	which we have contended."
10693	
10694	Washington himself was profoundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays's
10695	rebellion, he exclaimed: "What, gracious God, is man that there should
10696	be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the
10697	other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions
10698	under which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and
10699	now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them." The same year he
10700	burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. "I am
10701	told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government
10702	without horror. From thinking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is
10703	often but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a
10704	triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for
10705	the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing
10706	ourselves!"
10707	
10708	=Congress Attempts Some Reforms.=--The Congress was not indifferent to
10709	the events that disturbed Washington. On the contrary it put forth many
10710	efforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance, commerce,
10711	industries, and the Confederation itself. In 1781, even before the
10712	treaty of peace was signed, the Congress, having found out how futile
10713	were its taxing powers, carried a resolution of amendment to the
10714	Articles of Confederation, authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on
10715	imports. Yet this mild measure was rejected by the states. Two years
10716	later the Congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of
10717	duties on imports, to be collected this time by state officers and
10718	applied to the payment of the public debt. This more limited proposal,
10719	designed to save public credit, likewise failed. In 1786, the Congress
10720	made a third appeal to the states for help, declaring that they had been
10721	so irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further
10722	reliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and
10723	dangerous.
10724	
10725	
10726	THE CALLING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION
10727	
10728	=Hamilton and Washington Urge Reform.=--The attempts at reform by the
10729	Congress were accompanied by demand for, both within and without that
10730	body, a convention to frame a new plan of government. In 1780, the
10731	youthful Alexander Hamilton, realizing the weakness of the Articles, so
10732	widely discussed, proposed a general convention for the purpose of
10733	drafting a new constitution on entirely different principles. With
10734	tireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view.
10735	Washington, agreeing with him on every point, declared, in a circular
10736	letter to the governors, that the duration of the union would be short
10737	unless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power "to regulate and
10738	govern the general concerns of the confederated republic." The governor
10739	of Massachusetts, disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him,
10740	suggested to the state legislature in 1785 the advisability of a
10741	national convention to enlarge the powers of the Congress. The
10742	legislature approved the plan, but did not press it to a conclusion.
10743	
10744	[Illustration: ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
10745	
10746	=The Annapolis Convention.=--Action finally came from the South. The
10747	Virginia legislature, taking things into its own hands, called a
10748	conference of delegates at Annapolis to consider matters of taxation and
10749	commerce. When the convention assembled in 1786, it was found that only
10750	five states had taken the trouble to send representatives. The leaders
10751	were deeply discouraged, but the resourceful Hamilton, a delegate from
10752	New York, turned the affair to good account. He secured the adoption of
10753	a resolution, calling upon the Congress itself to summon another
10754	convention, to meet at Philadelphia.
10755	
10756	=A National Convention Called (1787).=--The Congress, as tardy as ever,
10757	at last decided in February, 1787, to issue the call. Fearing drastic
10758	changes, however, it restricted the convention to "the sole and express
10759	purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation." Jealous of its own
10760	powers, it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the
10761	Congress and the states for their approval.
10762	
10763	Every state in the union, except Rhode Island, responded to this call.
10764	Indeed some of the states, having the Annapolis resolution before them,
10765	had already anticipated the Congress by selecting delegates before the
10766	formal summons came. Thus, by the persistence of governors,
10767	legislatures, and private citizens, there was brought about the
10768	long-desired national convention. In May, 1787, it assembled in
10769	Philadelphia.
10770	
10771	=The Eminent Men of the Convention.=--On the roll of that memorable
10772	convention were fifty-five men, at least half of whom were acknowledged
10773	to be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in America. Every field
10774	of statecraft was represented by them: war and practical management in
10775	Washington, who was chosen president of the convention; diplomacy in
10776	Franklin, now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad;
10777	finance in Alexander Hamilton and Robert Morris; law in James Wilson of
10778	Pennsylvania; the philosophy of government in James Madison, called the
10779	"father of the Constitution." They were not theorists but practical men,
10780	rich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the
10781	springs of human action. Three of them had served in the Stamp Act
10782	Congress: Dickinson of Delaware, William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut,
10783	and John Rutledge of South Carolina. Eight had been signers of the
10784	Declaration of Independence: Read of Delaware, Sherman of Connecticut,
10785	Wythe of Virginia, Gerry of Massachusetts, Franklin, Robert Morris,
10786	George Clymer, and James Wilson of Pennsylvania. All but twelve had at
10787	some time served in the Continental Congress and eighteen were members
10788	of that body in the spring of 1787. Washington, Hamilton, Mifflin, and
10789	Charles Pinckney had been officers in the Revolutionary army. Seven of
10790	the delegates had gained political experience as governors of states.
10791	"The convention as a whole," according to the historian Hildreth,
10792	"represented in a marked manner the talent, intelligence, and
10793	especially the conservative sentiment of the country."
10794	
10795	
10796	THE FRAMING OF THE CONSTITUTION
10797	
10798	=Problems Involved.=--The great problems before the convention were nine
10799	in number: (1) Shall the Articles of Confederation be revised or a new
10800	system of government constructed? (2) Shall the government be founded on
10801	states equal in power as under the Articles or on the broader and deeper
10802	foundation of population? (3) What direct share shall the people have in
10803	the election of national officers? (4) What shall be the qualifications
10804	for the suffrage? (5) How shall the conflicting interests of the
10805	commercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the
10806	essential rights of each? (6) What shall be the form of the new
10807	government? (7) What powers shall be conferred on it? (8) How shall the
10808	state legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights
10809	such as the issuance of paper money? (9) Shall the approval of all the
10810	states be necessary, as under the Articles, for the adoption and
10811	amendment of the Constitution?
10812	
10813	=Revision of the Articles or a New Government?=--The moment the first
10814	problem was raised, representatives of the small states, led by William
10815	Paterson of New Jersey, were on their feet. They feared that, if the
10816	Articles were overthrown, the equality and rights of the states would be
10817	put in jeopardy. Their protest was therefore vigorous. They cited the
10818	call issued by the Congress in summoning the convention which
10819	specifically stated that they were assembled for "the sole and express
10820	purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation." They cited also
10821	their instructions from their state legislatures, which authorized them
10822	to "revise and amend" the existing scheme of government, not to make a
10823	revolution in it. To depart from the authorization laid down by the
10824	Congress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers, they
10825	argued, and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymen.
10826	
10827	To their contentions, Randolph of Virginia replied: "When the salvation
10828	of the republic is at stake, it would be treason to our trust not to
10829	propose what we find necessary." Hamilton, reminding the delegates that
10830	their work was still subject to the approval of the states, frankly said
10831	that on the point of their powers he had no scruples. With the issue
10832	clear, the convention cast aside the Articles as if they did not exist
10833	and proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution, "laying its
10834	foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form"
10835	as to the delegates seemed "most likely to affect their safety and
10836	happiness."
10837	
10838	=A Government Founded on States or on People?--The
10839	Compromise.=--Defeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a
10840	mere revision of the Articles, the spokesmen of the smaller states
10841	redoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states. The
10842	signal for a radical departure from the Articles on this point was given
10843	early in the sessions when Randolph presented "the Virginia plan." He
10844	proposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses, the
10845	members of which were to be apportioned among the states according to
10846	their wealth or free white population, as the convention might decide.
10847	This plan was vehemently challenged. Paterson of New Jersey flatly
10848	avowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny. As
10849	an alternative, he presented "the New Jersey plan" calling for a
10850	national legislature of one house representing states as such, not
10851	wealth or people--a legislature in which all states, large or small,
10852	would have equal voice. Wilson of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the more
10853	populous states, took up the gauntlet which Paterson had thrown down. It
10854	was absurd, he urged, for 180,000 men in one state to have the same
10855	weight in national counsels as 750,000 men in another state. "The
10856	gentleman from New Jersey," he said, "is candid. He declares his opinion
10857	boldly.... I will be equally candid.... I will never confederate on his
10858	principles." So the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting
10859	sessions.
10860	
10861	Greek had met Greek. The convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the
10862	verge of dissolution, "scarce held together by the strength of a hair,"
10863	as one of the delegates remarked. A crash was averted only by a
10864	compromise. Instead of a Congress of one house as provided by the
10865	Articles, the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses. In the
10866	Senate, the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied, for
10867	each state was given two members in that body. In the formation of the
10868	House of Representatives, the larger states were placated, for it was
10869	agreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the
10870	states on the basis of population, counting three-fifths of the slaves.
10871	
10872	=The Question of Popular Election.=--The method of selecting federal
10873	officers and members of Congress also produced an acrimonious debate
10874	which revealed how deep-seated was the distrust of the capacity of the
10875	people to govern themselves. Few there were who believed that no branch
10876	of the government should be elected directly by the voters; still fewer
10877	were there, however, who desired to see all branches so chosen. One or
10878	two even expressed a desire for a monarchy. The dangers of democracy
10879	were stressed by Gerry of Massachusetts: "All the evils we experience
10880	flow from an excess of democracy. The people do not want virtue but are
10881	the dupes of pretended patriots.... I have been too republican
10882	heretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling
10883	spirit." To the "democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures,"
10884	Randolph sought to oppose a "firm senate." To check the excesses of
10885	popular government Charles Pinckney of South Carolina declared that no
10886	one should be elected President who was not worth $100,000 and that high
10887	property qualifications should be placed on members of Congress and
10888	judges. Other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such
10889	"high-toned notions of government." Franklin and Wilson, both from
10890	Pennsylvania, vigorously championed popular election; while men like
10891	Madison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on
10892	the broad foundation of the people.
10893	
10894	Out of this clash of opinion also came compromise. One branch, the House
10895	of Representatives, it was agreed, was to be elected directly by the
10896	voters, while the Senators were to be elected indirectly by the state
10897	legislatures. The President was to be chosen by electors selected as the
10898	legislatures of the states might determine, and the judges of the
10899	federal courts, supreme and inferior, by the President and the Senate.
10900	
10901	=The Question of the Suffrage.=--The battle over the suffrage was sharp
10902	but brief. Gouverneur Morris proposed that only land owners should be
10903	permitted to vote. Madison replied that the state legislatures, which
10904	had made so much trouble with radical laws, were elected by freeholders.
10905	After the debate, the delegates, unable to agree on any property
10906	limitations on the suffrage, decided that the House of Representatives
10907	should be elected by voters having the "qualifications requisite for
10908	electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature." Thus
10909	they accepted the suffrage provisions of the states.
10910	
10911	=The Balance between the Planting and the Commercial States.=--After the
10912	debates had gone on for a few weeks, Madison came to the conclusion that
10913	the real division in the convention was not between the large and the
10914	small states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and
10915	the commercial North. Thus he anticipated by nearly three-quarters of a
10916	century "the irrepressible conflict." The planting states had neither
10917	the free white population nor the wealth of the North. There were,
10918	counting Delaware, six of them as against seven commercial states.
10919	Dependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco, rice,
10920	and other staples abroad, they feared that Congress might impose
10921	restraints upon their enterprise. Being weaker in numbers, they were
10922	afraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon them.
10923	
10924	_Representation and Taxation._--The Southern members of the convention
10925	were therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest
10926	possible representation in Congress, and at the same time to restrain
10927	the taxing power of that body. Two devices were thought adapted to these
10928	ends. One was to count the slaves as people when apportioning
10929	representatives among the states according to their respective
10930	populations; the other was to provide that direct taxes should be
10931	apportioned among the states, in proportion not to their wealth but to
10932	the number of their free white inhabitants. For obvious reasons the
10933	Northern delegates objected to these proposals. Once more a compromise
10934	proved to be the solution. It was agreed that not all the slaves but
10935	three-fifths of them should be counted for both purposes--representation
10936	and direct taxation.
10937	
10938	_Commerce and the Slave Trade._--Southern interests were also involved
10939	in the project to confer upon Congress the power to regulate interstate
10940	and foreign commerce. To the manufacturing and trading states this was
10941	essential. It would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies; it
10942	would enable Congress to protect American manufactures and to break
10943	down, by appropriate retaliations, foreign discriminations against
10944	American commerce. To the South the proposal was menacing because
10945	tariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of
10946	plantations in European markets, and navigation acts might confine the
10947	carrying trade to American, that is Northern, ships. The importation of
10948	slaves, moreover, it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately
10949	prohibited altogether.
10950	
10951	The result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits
10952	of slavery. Gouverneur Morris delivered his mind and heart on that
10953	subject, denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of
10954	heaven on the states in which it prevailed. Mason of Virginia, a
10955	slaveholder himself, was hardly less outspoken, saying: "Slavery
10956	discourages arts and manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed
10957	by slaves. They prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen
10958	and enrich a country."
10959	
10960	The system, however, had its defenders. Representatives from South
10961	Carolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor
10962	and that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous
10963	importation necessary. Ellsworth of Connecticut took the ground that
10964	the convention should not meddle with slavery. "The morality or wisdom
10965	of slavery," he said, "are considerations belonging to the states. What
10966	enriches a part enriches the whole." To the future he turned an
10967	untroubled face: "As population increases, poor laborers will be so
10968	plenty as to render slaves useless. Slavery in time will not be a speck
10969	in our country." Virginia and North Carolina, already overstocked with
10970	slaves, favored prohibiting the traffic in them; but South Carolina was
10971	adamant. She must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not
10972	federate.
10973	
10974	So it was agreed that, while Congress might regulate foreign trade by
10975	majority vote, the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before
10976	the lapse of twenty years, and that any import tax should not exceed $10
10977	a head. At the same time, in connection with the regulation of foreign
10978	trade, it was stipulated that a two-thirds vote in the Senate should be
10979	necessary in the ratification of treaties. A further concession to the
10980	South was made in the provision for the return of runaway slaves--a
10981	provision also useful in the North, where indentured servants were about
10982	as troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters.
10983	
10984	=The Form of the Government.=--As to the details of the frame of
10985	government and the grand principles involved, the opinion of the
10986	convention ebbed and flowed, decisions being taken in the heat of
10987	debate, only to be revoked and taken again.
10988	
10989	_The Executive._--There was general agreement that there should be an
10990	executive branch; for reliance upon Congress to enforce its own laws and
10991	treaties had been a broken reed. On the character and functions of the
10992	executive, however, there were many views. The New Jersey plan called
10993	for a council selected by the Congress; the Virginia plan provided that
10994	the executive branch should be chosen by the Congress but did not state
10995	whether it should be composed of one or several persons. On this matter
10996	the convention voted first one way and then another; finally it agreed
10997	on a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the
10998	state legislatures might decide, serving for four years, subject to
10999	impeachment, and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army
11000	and the navy and in the enforcement of the laws.
11001	
11002	_The Legislative Branch--Congress._--After the convention had made the
11003	great compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving
11004	representation to states in the Senate and to population in the House,
11005	the question of methods of election had to be decided. As to the House
11006	of Representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be
11007	elected by direct popular vote. There was also easy agreement on the
11008	proposition that a strong Senate was needed to check the "turbulence" of
11009	the lower house. Four devices were finally selected to accomplish this
11010	purpose. In the first place, the Senators were not to be chosen directly
11011	by the voters but by the legislatures of the states, thus removing their
11012	election one degree from the populace. In the second place, their term
11013	was fixed at six years instead of two, as in the case of the House. In
11014	the third place, provision was made for continuity by having only
11015	one-third of the members go out at a time while two-thirds remained in
11016	service. Finally, it was provided that Senators must be at least thirty
11017	years old while Representatives need be only twenty-five.
11018	
11019	_The Judiciary._--The need for federal courts to carry out the law was
11020	hardly open to debate. The feebleness of the Articles of Confederation
11021	was, in a large measure, attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold
11022	states and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the
11023	union. Nevertheless on this point the advocates of states' rights were
11024	extremely sensitive. They looked with distrust upon judges appointed at
11025	the national capital and emancipated from local interests and
11026	traditions; they remembered with what insistence they had claimed
11027	against Britain the right of local trial by jury and with what
11028	consternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges
11029	independent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries.
11030	Reluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts, consenting at
11031	first only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state
11032	courts and finally to such additional inferior courts as Congress might
11033	deem necessary.
11034	
11035	_The System of Checks and Balances._--It is thus apparent that the
11036	framers of the Constitution, in shaping the form of government, arranged
11037	for a distribution of power among three branches, executive,
11038	legislative, and judicial. Strictly speaking we might say four branches,
11039	for the legislature, or Congress, was composed of two houses, elected in
11040	different ways, and one of them, the Senate, was made a check on the
11041	President through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments. "The
11042	accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, in the
11043	same hands," wrote Madison, "whether of one, a few, or many, and whether
11044	hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the
11045	very definition of tyranny." The devices which the convention adopted to
11046	prevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious
11047	and well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authors.
11048	
11049	The legislature consisted of two houses, the members of which were to be
11050	apportioned on a different basis, elected in different ways, and to
11051	serve for different terms. A veto on all its acts was vested in a
11052	President elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either
11053	branch of the legislature, serving for four years, and subject to
11054	removal only by the difficult process of impeachment. After a law had
11055	run the gantlet of both houses and the executive, it was subject to
11056	interpretation and annulment by the judiciary, appointed by the
11057	President with the consent of the Senate and serving for life. Thus it
11058	was made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of
11059	all branches of the government at a single popular election. As Hamilton
11060	remarked, the friends of good government considered "every institution
11061	calculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in
11062	the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more
11063	likely to do good than harm."
11064	
11065	=The Powers of the Federal Government.=--On the question of the powers
11066	to be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a
11067	serious dispute. Even the delegates from the small states agreed with
11068	those from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia that new powers
11069	should be added to those intrusted to Congress by the Articles of
11070	Confederation. The New Jersey plan as well as the Virginia plan
11071	recognized this fact. Some of the delegates, like Hamilton and Madison,
11072	even proposed to give Congress a general legislative authority covering
11073	all national matters; but others, frightened by the specter of
11074	nationalism, insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and
11075	finally carried the day.
11076	
11077	_Taxation and Commerce._--There were none bold enough to dissent from
11078	the proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses
11079	and discharge the public debt. When once the dispute over the
11080	apportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled, it was
11081	an easy matter to decide that Congress should have power to lay and
11082	collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. In this way the national
11083	government was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy
11084	legislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens. There
11085	were likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state
11086	tariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured. When the
11087	fears of the planting states were allayed and the "bargain" over the
11088	importation of slaves was reached, the convention vested in Congress the
11089	power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce.
11090	
11091	_National Defense._--The necessity for national defense was realized,
11092	though the fear of huge military establishments was equally present. The
11093	old practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures
11094	was completely discredited. As in the case of taxes a direct authority
11095	over citizens was demanded. Congress was therefore given full power to
11096	raise and support armies and a navy. It could employ the state militia
11097	when desirable; but it could at the same time maintain a regular army
11098	and call directly upon all able-bodied males if the nature of a crisis
11099	was thought to require it.
11100	
11101	_The "Necessary and Proper" Clause._--To the specified power vested in
11102	Congress by the Constitution, the advocates of a strong national
11103	government added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws
11104	"necessary and proper" for carrying into effect any and all of the
11105	enumerated powers. This clause, interpreted by that master mind, Chief
11106	Justice Marshall, was later construed to confer powers as wide as the
11107	requirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place
11108	among the mighty nations of the earth.
11109	
11110	=Restraints on the States.=--Framing a government and endowing it with
11111	large powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention. Its
11112	very existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state
11113	legislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed Continental Congress.
11114	In every state, explains Marshall in his _Life of Washington_, there was
11115	a party of men who had "marked out for themselves a more indulgent
11116	course. Viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor, their
11117	efforts were unceasingly directed to his relief. To exact a faithful
11118	compliance with contracts was, in their opinion, a harsh measure which
11119	the people could not bear. They were uniformly in favor of relaxing the
11120	administration of justice, of affording facilities for the payment of
11121	debts, or of suspending their collection, and remitting taxes."
11122	
11123	The legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper
11124	money laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily.
11125	The convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state
11126	should emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal
11127	tender in the payment of debts. The state legislatures had enacted laws
11128	allowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or
11129	personal property; they had repealed the charter of an endowed college
11130	and taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees; and they
11131	had otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements. The
11132	convention, taking notice of such matters, inserted a clause forbidding
11133	states "to impair the obligation of contracts." The more venturous of
11134	the radicals had in Massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against
11135	the authorities of the state. The convention answered by a brief
11136	sentence to the effect that the President of the United States, to be
11137	equipped with a regular army, would send troops to suppress domestic
11138	insurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or, if it was not
11139	in session, by the governor of the state. To make sure that the
11140	restrictions on the states would not be dead letters, the federal
11141	Constitution, laws, and treaties were made the supreme law of the land,
11142	to be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive
11143	against violations on the part of any state authorities.
11144	
11145	=Provisions for Ratification and Amendment.=--When the frame of
11146	government had been determined, the powers to be vested in it had been
11147	enumerated, and the restrictions upon the states had been written into
11148	the bond, there remained three final questions. How shall the
11149	Constitution be ratified? What number of states shall be necessary to
11150	put it into effect? How shall it be amended in the future?
11151	
11152	On the first point, the mandate under which the convention was sitting
11153	seemed positive. The Articles of Confederation were still in effect.
11154	They provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption
11155	in Congress and the approval of all the states. As if to give force to
11156	this provision of law, the call for the convention had expressly stated
11157	that all alterations and revisions should be reported to Congress for
11158	adoption or rejection, Congress itself to transmit the document
11159	thereafter to the states for their review.
11160	
11161	To have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the
11162	purposes of the delegates, because Congress and the state legislatures
11163	were openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made. Unanimous
11164	ratification, as events proved, would have been impossible. Therefore
11165	the delegates decided that the Constitution should be sent to Congress
11166	with the recommendation that it, in turn, transmit the document, not to
11167	the state legislatures, but to conventions held in the states for the
11168	special object of deciding upon ratification. This process was followed.
11169	It was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than
11170	the state legislatures.
11171	
11172	The convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the
11173	number of states necessary to establish the new Constitution. Attempts
11174	to change the Articles had failed because amendment required the
11175	approval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant
11176	member of the union. The opposition to a new Constitution was
11177	undoubtedly formidable. Rhode Island had even refused to take part in
11178	framing it, and her hostility was deep and open. So the convention cast
11179	aside the provision of the Articles of Confederation which required
11180	unanimous approval for any change in the plan of government; it decreed
11181	that the new Constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine
11182	states.
11183	
11184	In providing for future changes in the Constitution itself the
11185	convention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval, and
11186	decided that an amendment could be made on a two-thirds vote in both
11187	houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. This
11188	change was of profound significance. Every state agreed to be bound in
11189	the future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve
11190	them itself. America in this way set out upon the high road that led
11191	from a league of states to a nation.
11192	
11193	
11194	THE STRUGGLE OVER RATIFICATION
11195	
11196	On September 17, 1787, the Constitution, having been finally drafted in
11197	clear and simple language, a model to all makers of fundamental law, was
11198	adopted. The convention, after nearly four months of debate in secret
11199	session, flung open the doors and presented to the Americans the
11200	finished plan for the new government. Then the great debate passed to
11201	the people.
11202	
11203	=The Opposition.=--Storms of criticism at once descended upon the
11204	Constitution. "Fraudulent usurpation!" exclaimed Gerry, who had refused
11205	to sign it. "A monster" out of the "thick veil of secrecy," declaimed a
11206	Pennsylvania newspaper. "An iron-handed despotism will be the result,"
11207	protested a third. "We, 'the low-born,'" sarcastically wrote a fourth,
11208	"will now admit the 'six hundred well-born' immediately to establish
11209	this most noble, most excellent, and truly divine constitution." The
11210	President will become a king; Congress will be as tyrannical as
11211	Parliament in the old days; the states will be swallowed up; the rights
11212	of the people will be trampled upon; the poor man's justice will be lost
11213	in the endless delays of the federal courts--such was the strain of the
11214	protests against ratification.
11215	
11216	[Illustration: AN ADVERTISEMENT OF _The Federalist_]
11217	
11218	=Defense of the Constitution.=--Moved by the tempest of opposition,
11219	Hamilton, Madison, and Jay took up their pens in defense of the
11220	Constitution. In a series of newspaper articles they discussed and
11221	expounded with eloquence, learning, and dignity every important clause
11222	and provision of the proposed plan. These papers, afterwards collected
11223	and published in a volume known as _The Federalist_, form the finest
11224	textbook on the Constitution that has ever been printed. It takes its
11225	place, moreover, among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government
11226	ever written in any language in any time. Other men, not so gifted, were
11227	no less earnest in their support of ratification. In private
11228	correspondence, editorials, pamphlets, and letters to the newspapers,
11229	they urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a
11230	Constitution which, in spite of any defects great or small, was the
11231	only guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and
11232	weakness abroad.
11233	
11234	[Illustration: CELEBRATING THE RATIFICATION]
11235	
11236	=The Action of the State Conventions.=--Before the end of the year,
11237	1787, three states had ratified the Constitution: Delaware and New
11238	Jersey unanimously and Pennsylvania after a short, though savage,
11239	contest. Connecticut and Georgia followed early the next year. Then came
11240	the battle royal in Massachusetts, ending in ratification in February by
11241	the narrow margin of 187 votes to 168. In the spring came the news that
11242	Maryland and South Carolina were "under the new roof." On June 21, New
11243	Hampshire, where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the
11244	Constitution, joined the new republic, influenced by the favorable
11245	decision in Massachusetts. Swift couriers were sent to carry the news to
11246	New York and Virginia, where the question of ratification was still
11247	undecided. Nine states had accepted it and were united, whether more saw
11248	fit to join or not.
11249	
11250	Meanwhile, however, Virginia, after a long and searching debate, had
11251	given her approval by a narrow margin, leaving New York as the next seat
11252	of anxiety. In that state the popular vote for the delegates to the
11253	convention had been clearly and heavily against ratification. Events
11254	finally demonstrated the futility of resistance, and Hamilton by good
11255	judgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority
11256	of thirty to twenty-seven votes in favor of ratification.
11257	
11258	The great contest was over. All the states, except North Carolina and
11259	Rhode Island, had ratified. "The sloop Anarchy," wrote an ebullient
11260	journalist, "when last heard from was ashore on Union rocks."
11261	
11262	=The First Election.=--In the autumn of 1788, elections were held to
11263	fill the places in the new government. Public opinion was overwhelmingly
11264	in favor of Washington as the first President. Yielding to the
11265	importunities of friends, he accepted the post in the spirit of public
11266	service. On April 30, 1789, he took the oath of office at Federal Hall
11267	in New York City. "Long live George Washington, President of the United
11268	States!" cried Chancellor Livingston as soon as the General had kissed
11269	the Bible. The cry was caught by the assembled multitude and given back.
11270	A new experiment in popular government was launched.

11354	THE CLASH OF POLITICAL PARTIES
11355	
11356	
11357	THE MEN AND MEASURES OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT
11358	
11359	=Friends of the Constitution in Power.=--In the first Congress that
11360	assembled after the adoption of the Constitution, there were eleven
11361	Senators, led by Robert Morris, the financier, who had been delegates to
11362	the national convention. Several members of the House of
11363	Representatives, headed by James Madison, had also been at Philadelphia
11364	in 1787. In making his appointments, Washington strengthened the new
11365	system of government still further by a judicious selection of
11366	officials. He chose as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,
11367	who had been the most zealous for its success; General Knox, head of the
11368	War Department, and Edmund Randolph, the Attorney-General, were likewise
11369	conspicuous friends of the experiment. Every member of the federal
11370	judiciary whom Washington appointed, from the Chief Justice, John Jay,
11371	down to the justices of the district courts, had favored the
11372	ratification of the Constitution; and a majority of them had served as
11373	members of the national convention that framed the document or of the
11374	state ratifying conventions. Only one man of influence in the new
11375	government, Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, was reckoned as a
11376	doubter in the house of the faithful. He had expressed opinions both for
11377	and against the Constitution; but he had been out of the country acting
11378	as the minister at Paris when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.
11379	
11380	=An Opposition to Conciliate.=--The inauguration of Washington amid the
11381	plaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil
11382	which had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification. "The
11383	interesting nature of the question," wrote John Marshall, "the equality
11384	of the parties, the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a
11385	necessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to
11386	fix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of
11387	government in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted." The
11388	leaders gathered around Washington were well aware of the excited state
11389	of the country. They saw Rhode Island and North Carolina still outside
11390	of the union.[1] They knew by what small margins the Constitution had
11391	been approved in the great states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New
11392	York. They were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions,
11393	in yielding reluctant approval to the Constitution, had drawn a number
11394	of amendments for immediate submission to the states.
11395	
11396	=The First Amendments--a Bill of Rights.=--To meet the opposition,
11397	Madison proposed, and the first Congress adopted, a series of amendments
11398	to the Constitution. Ten of them were soon ratified and became in 1791 a
11399	part of the law of the land. These amendments provided, among other
11400	things, that Congress could make no law respecting the establishment of
11401	religion, abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right
11402	of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a
11403	redress of grievances. They also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and
11404	trial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious
11405	crimes. To reassure those who still feared that local rights might be
11406	invaded by the federal government, the tenth amendment expressly
11407	provided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the
11408	Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the
11409	states respectively or to the people. Seven years later, the eleventh
11410	amendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten, after a
11411	heated debate over the action of the Supreme Court in permitting a
11412	citizen to bring a suit against "the sovereign state" of Georgia. The
11413	new amendment was designed to protect states against the federal
11414	judiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by
11415	a citizen.
11416	
11417	=Funding the National Debt.=--Paper declarations of rights, however,
11418	paid no bills. To this task Hamilton turned all his splendid genius. At
11419	the very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public
11420	debt, daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated. In a _Report on
11421	Public Credit_ under date of January 9, 1790, one of the first and
11422	greatest of American state papers, he laid before Congress the outlines
11423	of his plan. He proposed that the federal government should call in all
11424	the old bonds, certificates of indebtedness, and other promises to pay
11425	which had been issued by the Congress since the beginning of the
11426	Revolution. These national obligations, he urged, should be put into one
11427	consolidated debt resting on the credit of the United States; to the
11428	holders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at
11429	fixed rates. This process was called "funding the debt." Such a
11430	provision for the support of public credit, Hamilton insisted, would
11431	satisfy creditors, restore landed property to its former value, and
11432	furnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit
11433	and capital.
11434	
11435	=Assumption and Funding of State Debts.=--Hamilton then turned to the
11436	obligations incurred by the several states in support of the Revolution.
11437	These debts he proposed to add to the national debt. They were to be
11438	"assumed" by the United States government and placed on the same secure
11439	foundation as the continental debt. This measure he defended not merely
11440	on grounds of national honor. It would, as he foresaw, give strength to
11441	the new national government by making all public creditors, men of
11442	substance in their several communities, look to the federal, rather than
11443	the state government, for the satisfaction of their claims.
11444	
11445	=Funding at Face Value.=--On the question of the terms of consolidation,
11446	assumption, and funding, Hamilton had a firm conviction. That millions
11447	of dollars' worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of
11448	the hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the
11449	support of the government or had sold supplies for the Revolutionary
11450	army was well known. It was also a matter of common knowledge that a
11451	very large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous
11452	figures--ten, twenty, and thirty cents on the dollar. Accordingly, it
11453	had been suggested, even in very respectable quarters, that a
11454	discrimination should be made between original holders and speculative
11455	purchasers. Some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who
11456	had paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their
11457	outlays and the original holders paid the difference; others said that
11458	the government should "scale the debt" by redeeming, not at full value
11459	but at a figure reasonably above the market price. Against the
11460	proposition Hamilton set his face like flint. He maintained that the
11461	government was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value,
11462	although the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate
11463	of interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on
11464	another part.
11465	
11466	=Funding and Assumption Carried.=--There was little difficulty in
11467	securing the approval of both houses of Congress for the funding of the
11468	national debt at full value. The bill for the assumption of state debts,
11469	however, brought the sharpest division of opinions. To the Southern
11470	members of Congress assumption was a gross violation of states' rights,
11471	without any warrant in the Constitution and devised in the interest of
11472	Northern speculators who, anticipating assumption and funding, had
11473	bought up at low prices the Southern bonds and other promises to pay.
11474	New England, on the other hand, was strongly in favor of assumption;
11475	several representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a
11476	dissolution of the union if the bill was defeated. To this dispute was
11477	added an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national
11478	capital, then temporarily at New York City.
11479	
11480	[Illustration: FIRST UNITED STATES BANK AT PHILADELPHIA]
11481	
11482	A deadlock, accompanied by the most surly feelings on both sides,
11483	threatened the very existence of the young government. Washington and
11484	Hamilton were thoroughly alarmed. Hearing of the extremity to which the
11485	contest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the Secretary of
11486	the Treasury, Jefferson intervened at this point. By skillful management
11487	at a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together; and thus once
11488	more, as on many other occasions, peace was purchased and the union
11489	saved by compromise. The bargain this time consisted of an exchange of
11490	votes for assumption in return for votes for the capital. Enough
11491	Southern members voted for assumption to pass the bill, and a majority
11492	was mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the
11493	Potomac, after locating it for a ten-year period at Philadelphia to
11494	satisfy Pennsylvania members.
11495	
11496	=The United States Bank.=--Encouraged by the success of his funding and
11497	assumption measures, Hamilton laid before Congress a project for a great
11498	United States Bank. He proposed that a private corporation be chartered
11499	by Congress, authorized to raise a capital stock of $10,000,000
11500	(three-fourths in new six per cent federal bonds and one-fourth in
11501	specie) and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards.
11502	Many advantages, Hamilton contended, would accrue to the government from
11503	this institution. The price of the government bonds would be increased,
11504	thus enhancing public credit. A national currency would be created of
11505	uniform value from one end of the land to the other. The branches of the
11506	bank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to
11507	commercial transactions on a national scale. Finally, through the issue
11508	of bank notes, the money capital available for agriculture and industry
11509	would be increased, thus stimulating business enterprise. Jefferson
11510	hotly attacked the bank on the ground that Congress had no power
11511	whatever under the Constitution to charter such a private corporation.
11512	Hamilton defended it with great cogency. Washington, after weighing all
11513	opinions, decided in favor of the proposal. In 1791 the bill
11514	establishing the first United States Bank for a period of twenty years
11515	became a law.
11516	
11517	=The Protective Tariff.=--A third part of Hamilton's program was the
11518	protection of American industries. The first revenue act of 1789, though
11519	designed primarily to bring money into the empty treasury, declared in
11520	favor of the principle. The following year Washington referred to the
11521	subject in his address to Congress. Thereupon Hamilton was instructed to
11522	prepare recommendations for legislative action. The result, after a
11523	delay of more than a year, was his _Report on Manufactures_, another
11524	state paper worthy, in closeness of reasoning and keenness of
11525	understanding, of a place beside his report on public credit. Hamilton
11526	based his argument on the broadest national grounds: the protective
11527	tariff would, by encouraging the building of factories, create a home
11528	market for the produce of farms and plantations; by making the United
11529	States independent of other countries in times of peace, it would double
11530	its security in time of war; by making use of the labor of women and
11531	children, it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise
11532	idle or only partly employed; by increasing the trade between the North
11533	and South it would strengthen the links of union and add to political
11534	ties those of commerce and intercourse. The revenue measure of 1792 bore
11535	the impress of these arguments.
11536	
11537	
11538	THE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES
11539	
11540	=Dissensions over Hamilton's Measures.=--Hamilton's plans, touching
11541	deeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the
11542	states, awakened alarm and opposition. Funding at face value, said his
11543	critics, was a government favor to speculators; the assumption of state
11544	debts was a deep design to undermine the state governments; Congress had
11545	no constitutional power to create a bank; the law creating the bank
11546	merely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at
11547	a high rate of interest; and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for
11548	the benefit of manufacturers.
11549	
11550	Hamilton's reply to this bill of indictment was simple and
11551	straightforward. Some rascally speculators had profited from the funding
11552	of the debt at face value, but that was only an incident in the
11553	restoration of public credit. In view of the jealousies of the states it
11554	was a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions. The
11555	Constitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of
11556	national needs. The bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely
11557	needed to start up American industries, giving markets to farmers and
11558	planters. The tariff by creating a home market and increasing
11559	opportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor. Out of
11560	such wise policies firmly pursued by the government, he concluded, were
11561	bound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home,
11562	credit and power abroad. This view Washington fully indorsed, adding
11563	the weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures
11564	adopted under his administration.
11565	
11566	=The Sharpness of the Partisan Conflict.=--As a result of the clash of
11567	opinion, the people of the country gradually divided into two parties:
11568	Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the former led by Hamilton, the latter
11569	by Jefferson. The strength of the Federalists lay in the cities--Boston,
11570	Providence, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston--among the
11571	manufacturing, financial, and commercial groups of the population who
11572	were eager to extend their business operations. The strength of the
11573	Anti-Federalists lay mainly among the debt-burdened farmers who feared
11574	the growth of what they called "a money power" and planters in all
11575	sections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing
11576	interests. The farming and planting South, outside of the few towns,
11577	finally presented an almost solid front against assumption, the bank,
11578	and the tariff. The conflict between the parties grew steadily in
11579	bitterness, despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which
11580	Hamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the
11581	constant efforts of Washington to soften the asperity of the
11582	contestants.
11583	
11584	=The Leadership and Doctrines of Jefferson.=--The party dispute had not
11585	gone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to
11586	Jefferson as their leader. Some of Hamilton's measures he had approved,
11587	declaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their
11588	significance. Others, particularly the bank, he fiercely assailed. More
11589	than once, he and Hamilton, shaking violently with anger, attacked each
11590	other at cabinet meetings, and nothing short of the grave and dignified
11591	pleas of Washington prevented an early and open break between them. In
11592	1794 it finally came. Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State and
11593	retired to his home in Virginia to assume, through correspondence and
11594	negotiation, the leadership of the steadily growing party of opposition.
11595	
11596	Shy and modest in manner, halting in speech, disliking the turmoil of
11597	public debate, and deeply interested in science and philosophy,
11598	Jefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political
11599	contest. Nevertheless, he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator. He was
11600	also by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of
11601	Hamilton. The latter believed in a strong, active, "high-toned"
11602	government, vigorously compelling in all its branches. Jefferson looked
11603	upon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and
11604	openly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular
11605	uprisings. Hamilton distrusted the people. "Your people is a great
11606	beast," he is reported to have said. Jefferson professed his faith in
11607	the people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his time.
11608	
11609	On economic matters, the opinions of the two leaders were also
11610	hopelessly at variance. Hamilton, while cherishing agriculture, desired
11611	to see America a great commercial and industrial nation. Jefferson was
11612	equally set against this course for his country. He feared the
11613	accumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class.
11614	The mobs of great cities, he said, are sores on the body politic;
11615	artisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions;
11616	workshops should be kept in Europe and with them the artisans with their
11617	insidious morals and manners. The only substantial foundation for a
11618	republic, Jefferson believed to be agriculture. The spirit of
11619	independence could be kept alive only by free farmers, owning the land
11620	they tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their
11621	hands for their sustenance. Trusting as he did in the innate goodness of
11622	human nature when nourished on a free soil, Jefferson advocated those
11623	measures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of
11624	persons rather than the powers of government. Thus he became the
11625	champion of the individual against the interference of the government,
11626	and an ardent advocate of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and
11627	freedom of scientific inquiry. It was, accordingly, no mere factious
11628	spirit that drove him into opposition to Hamilton.
11629	
11630	=The Whisky Rebellion.=--The political agitation of the Anti-Federalists
11631	was accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in 1794. The
11632	occasion for this uprising was another of Hamilton's measures, a law
11633	laying an excise tax on distilled spirits, for the purpose of increasing
11634	the revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt. It so
11635	happened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the
11636	country was made by the farmers, especially on the frontier, in their
11637	own stills. The new revenue law meant that federal officers would now
11638	come into the homes of the people, measure their liquor, and take the
11639	tax out of their pockets. All the bitterness which farmers felt against
11640	the fiscal measures of the government was redoubled. In the western
11641	districts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, they refused to
11642	pay the tax. In Pennsylvania, some of them sacked and burned the houses
11643	of the tax collectors, as the Revolutionists thirty years before had
11644	mobbed the agents of King George sent over to sell stamps. They were in
11645	a fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when Washington called
11646	out the troops to suppress "the Whisky Rebellion." Then the movement
11647	collapsed; but it left behind a deep-seated resentment which flared up
11648	in the election of several obdurate Anti-Federalist Congressmen from the
11649	disaffected regions.
11650	
11651	
11652	FOREIGN INFLUENCES AND DOMESTIC POLITICS
11653	
11654	=The French Revolution.=--In this exciting period, when all America was
11655	distracted by partisan disputes, a storm broke in Europe--the
11656	epoch-making French Revolution--which not only shook the thrones of the
11657	Old World but stirred to its depths the young republic of the New World.
11658	The first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 1789,
11659	a few days after Washington was inaugurated. The king of France, Louis
11660	XVI, driven into bankruptcy by extravagance and costly wars, was forced
11661	to resort to his people for financial help. Accordingly he called, for
11662	the first time in more than one hundred fifty years, a meeting of the
11663	national parliament, the "Estates General," composed of representatives
11664	of the "three estates"--the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Acting
11665	under powerful leaders, the commoners, or "third estate," swept aside
11666	the clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national
11667	assembly. This stirred the country to its depths.
11668	
11669	[Illustration: _From an old print_
11670	
11671	LOUIS XVI IN THE HANDS OF THE MOB]
11672	
11673	Great events followed in swift succession. On July 14, 1789, the
11674	Bastille, an old royal prison, symbol of the king's absolutism, was
11675	stormed by a Paris crowd and destroyed. On the night of August 4, the
11676	feudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national
11677	assembly amid great excitement. A few days later came the famous
11678	Declaration of the Rights of Man, proclaiming the sovereignty of the
11679	people and the privileges of citizens. In the autumn of 1791, Louis XVI
11680	was forced to accept a new constitution for France vesting the
11681	legislative power in a popular assembly. Little disorder accompanied
11682	these startling changes. To all appearances a peaceful revolution had
11683	stripped the French king of his royal prerogatives and based the
11684	government of his country on the consent of the governed.
11685	
11686	=American Influence in France.=--In undertaking their great political
11687	revolt the French had been encouraged by the outcome of the American
11688	Revolution. Officers and soldiers, who had served in the American war,
11689	reported to their French countrymen marvelous tales. At the frugal table
11690	of General Washington, in council with the unpretentious Franklin, or at
11691	conferences over the strategy of war, French noblemen of ancient lineage
11692	learned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the
11693	leaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas. Travelers,
11694	who had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes,
11695	carried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding
11696	system of popular government.
11697	
11698	On the other hand the dalliance with American democracy was regarded by
11699	French conservatives as playing with fire. "When we think of the false
11700	ideas of government and philanthropy," wrote one of Lafayette's aides,
11701	"which these youths acquired in America and propagated in France with so
11702	much enthusiasm and such deplorable success--for this mania of imitation
11703	powerfully aided the Revolution, though it was not the sole cause of
11704	it--we are bound to confess that it would have been better, both for
11705	themselves and for us, if these young philosophers in red-heeled shoes
11706	had stayed at home in attendance on the court."
11707	
11708	=Early American Opinion of the French Revolution.=--So close were the
11709	ties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every
11710	step in the first stages of the French Revolution greeted with applause
11711	in the United States. "Liberty will have another feather in her cap,"
11712	exultantly wrote a Boston editor. "In no part of the globe," soberly
11713	wrote John Marshall, "was this revolution hailed with more joy than in
11714	America.... But one sentiment existed." The main key to the Bastille,
11715	sent to Washington as a memento, was accepted as "a token of the
11716	victory gained by liberty." Thomas Paine saw in the great event "the
11717	first ripe fruits of American principles transplanted into Europe."
11718	Federalists and Anti-Federalists regarded the new constitution of France
11719	as another vindication of American ideals.
11720	
11721	=The Reign of Terror.=--While profuse congratulations were being
11722	exchanged, rumors began to come that all was not well in France. Many
11723	noblemen, enraged at the loss of their special privileges, fled into
11724	Germany and plotted an invasion of France to overthrow the new system of
11725	government. Louis XVI entered into negotiations with his brother
11726	monarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise,
11727	and he finally betrayed to the French people his true sentiments by
11728	attempting to escape from his kingdom, only to be captured and taken
11729	back to Paris in disgrace.
11730	
11731	A new phase of the revolution now opened. The working people, excluded
11732	from all share in the government by the first French constitution,
11733	became restless, especially in Paris. Assembling on the Champs de Mars,
11734	a great open field, they signed a petition calling for another
11735	constitution giving them the suffrage. When told to disperse, they
11736	refused and were fired upon by the national guard. This "massacre," as
11737	it was called, enraged the populace. A radical party, known as
11738	"Jacobins," then sprang up, taking its name from a Jacobin monastery in
11739	which it held its sessions. In a little while it became the master of
11740	the popular convention convoked in September, 1792. The monarchy was
11741	immediately abolished and a republic established. On January 21, 1793,
11742	Louis was sent to the scaffold. To the war on Austria, already raging,
11743	was added a war on England. Then came the Reign of Terror, during which
11744	radicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers
11745	counter-revolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the
11746	monarchy. They shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their
11747	rule and established a relentless dictatorship. Civil war followed.
11748	Terrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty,
11749	and in the name of monarchy. To Americans of conservative temper it now
11750	seemed that the Revolution, so auspiciously begun, had degenerated into
11751	anarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife.
11752	
11753	=Burke Summons the World to War on France.=--In England, Edmund Burke
11754	led the fight against the new French principles which he feared might
11755	spread to all Europe. In his _Reflections on the French Revolution_,
11756	written in 1790, he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of
11757	popular government; he called for war, relentless war, upon the French
11758	as monsters and outlaws; he demanded that they be reduced to order by
11759	the restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the
11760	arms of European nations.
11761	
11762	=Paine's Defense of the French Revolution.=--To counteract the campaign
11763	of hate against the French, Thomas Paine replied to Burke in another of
11764	his famous tracts, _The Rights of Man_, which was given to the American
11765	public in an edition containing a letter of approval from Jefferson.
11766	Burke, said Paine, had been mourning about the glories of the French
11767	monarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the
11768	oppressed people; had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying
11769	bird. Burke had denied the right of the French people to choose their
11770	own governors, blandly forgetting that the English government in which
11771	he saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions. He had boasted
11772	that the king of England held his crown in contempt of the democratic
11773	societies. Paine answered: "If I ask a man in America if he wants a
11774	king, he retorts and asks me if I take him for an idiot." To the charge
11775	that the doctrines of the rights of man were "new fangled," Paine
11776	replied that the question was not whether they were new or old but
11777	whether they were right or wrong. As to the French disorders and
11778	difficulties, he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth
11779	in due time.
11780	
11781	=The Effect of the French Revolution on American Politics.=--The course
11782	of the French Revolution and the controversies accompanying it,
11783	exercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political
11784	parties in America. The followers of Hamilton, now proud of the name
11785	"Federalists," drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds
11786	committed during the Reign of Terror. They turned savagely upon the
11787	revolutionists and their friends in America, denouncing as "Jacobin"
11788	everybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the
11789	French Republic. A Massachusetts preacher roundly assailed "the
11790	atheistical, anarchical, and in other respects immoral principles of the
11791	French Republicans"; he then proceeded with equal passion to attack
11792	Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists, whom he charged with spreading false
11793	French propaganda and betraying America. "The editors, patrons, and
11794	abettors of these vehicles of slander," he exclaimed, "ought to be
11795	considered and treated as enemies to their country.... Of all traitors
11796	they are the most aggravatedly criminal; of all villains, they are the
11797	most infamous and detestable."
11798	
11799	The Anti-Federalists, as a matter of fact, were generally favorable to
11800	the Revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with
11801	it. Paine's pamphlet, indorsed by Jefferson, was widely read. Democratic
11802	societies, after the fashion of French political clubs, arose in the
11803	cities; the coalition of European monarchs against France was denounced
11804	as a coalition against the very principles of republicanism; and the
11805	execution of Louis XVI was openly celebrated at a banquet in
11806	Philadelphia. Harmless titles, such as "Sir," "the Honorable," and "His
11807	Excellency," were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited
11808	insisted on adopting the French title, "Citizen," speaking, for example,
11809	of "Citizen Judge" and "Citizen Toastmaster." Pamphlets in defense of
11810	the French streamed from the press, while subsidized newspapers kept the
11811	propaganda in full swing.
11812	
11813	=The European War Disturbs American Commerce.=--This battle of wits, or
11814	rather contest in calumny, might have gone on indefinitely in America
11815	without producing any serious results, had it not been for the war
11816	between England and France, then raging. The English, having command of
11817	the seas, claimed the right to seize American produce bound for French
11818	ports and to confiscate American ships engaged in carrying French goods.
11819	Adding fuel to a fire already hot enough, they began to search American
11820	ships and to carry off British-born sailors found on board American
11821	vessels.
11822	
11823	=The French Appeal for Help.=--At the same time the French Republic
11824	turned to the United States for aid in its war on England and sent over
11825	as its diplomatic representative "Citizen" Genet, an ardent supporter of
11826	the new order. On his arrival at Charleston, he was greeted with fervor
11827	by the Anti-Federalists. As he made his way North, he was wined and
11828	dined and given popular ovations that turned his head. He thought the
11829	whole country was ready to join the French Republic in its contest with
11830	England. Genet therefore attempted to use the American ports as the base
11831	of operations for French privateers preying on British merchant ships;
11832	and he insisted that the United States was in honor bound to help France
11833	under the treaty of 1778.
11834	
11835	=The Proclamation of Neutrality and the Jay Treaty.=--Unmoved by the
11836	
11837	rising tide of popular sympathy for France, Washington took a firm
11838	course. He received Genet coldly. The demand that the United States aid
11839	France under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the
11840	neutrality of America and warning American citizens against hostile acts
11841	toward either France or England. When Genet continued to hold meetings,
11842	issue manifestoes, and stir up the people against England, Washington
11843	asked the French government to recall him. This act he followed up by
11844	sending the Chief Justice, John Jay, on a pacific mission to England.
11845	
11846	The result was the celebrated Jay treaty of 1794. By its terms Great
11847	Britain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they
11848	had been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight
11849	trade concessions. The chief sources of bitterness--the failure of the
11850	British to return slaves carried off during the Revolution, the seizure
11851	of American ships, and the impressment of sailors--were not touched,
11852	much to the distress of everybody in America, including loyal
11853	Federalists. Nevertheless, Washington, dreading an armed conflict with
11854	England, urged the Senate to ratify the treaty. The weight of his
11855	influence carried the day.
11856	
11857	At this, the hostility of the Anti-Federalists knew no bounds. Jefferson
11858	declared the Jay treaty "an infamous act which is really nothing more
11859	than an alliance between England and the Anglo-men of this country,
11860	against the legislature and the people of the United States." Hamilton,
11861	defending it with his usual courage, was stoned by a mob in New York and
11862	driven from the platform with blood streaming from his face. Jay was
11863	burned in effigy. Even Washington was not spared. The House of
11864	Representatives was openly hostile. To display its feelings, it called
11865	upon the President for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations,
11866	only to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them, on
11867	the ground that the House did not share in the treaty-making power.
11868	
11869	=Washington Retires from Politics.=--Such angry contests confirmed the
11870	President in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of
11871	his second term in office. He did not believe that a third term was
11872	unconstitutional or improper; but, worn out by his long and arduous
11873	labors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former
11874	friends, he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at Mount
11875	Vernon.
11876	
11877	In September, 1796, on the eve of the presidential election, Washington
11878	issued his Farewell Address, another state paper to be treasured and
11879	read by generations of Americans to come. In this address he directed
11880	the attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest. He
11881	warned them against sectional jealousies. He remonstrated against the
11882	spirit of partisanship, saying that in government "of the popular
11883	character, in government purely elective, it is a spirit not to be
11884	encouraged." He likewise cautioned the people against "the insidious
11885	wiles of foreign influence," saying: "Europe has a set of primary
11886	interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she
11887	must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are
11888	essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it would be
11889	unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary
11890	vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions
11891	of her friendships or enmities.... Why forego the advantages of so
11892	peculiar a situation?... It is our true policy to steer clear of
11893	permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.... Taking
11894	care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a
11895	respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary
11896	alliances for extraordinary emergencies."
11897	
11898	=The Campaign of 1796--Adams Elected.=--On hearing of the retirement of
11899	Washington, the Anti-Federalists cast off all restraints. In honor of
11900	France and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the
11901	monarchical tendencies of the Federalists, they boldly assumed the name
11902	"Republican"; the term "Democrat," then applied only to obscure and
11903	despised radicals, had not come into general use. They selected
11904	Jefferson as their candidate for President against John Adams, the
11905	Federalist nominee, and carried on such a spirited campaign that they
11906	came within four votes of electing him.
11907	
11908	The successful candidate, Adams, was not fitted by training or opinion
11909	for conciliating a determined opposition. He was a reserved and studious
11910	man. He was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator. In one of
11911	his books he had declared himself in favor of "government by an
11912	aristocracy of talents and wealth"--an offense which the Republicans
11913	never forgave. While John Marshall found him "a sensible, plain, candid,
11914	good-tempered man," Jefferson could see in him nothing but a "monocrat"
11915	and "Anglo-man." Had it not been for the conduct of the French
11916	government, Adams would hardly have enjoyed a moment's genuine
11917	popularity during his administration.
11918	
11919	=The Quarrel with France.=--The French Directory, the executive
11920	department established under the constitution of 1795, managed, however,
11921	to stir the anger of Republicans and Federalists alike. It regarded the
11922	Jay treaty as a rebuke to France and a flagrant violation of obligations
11923	solemnly registered in the treaty of 1778. Accordingly it refused to
11924	receive the American minister, treated him in a humiliating way, and
11925	finally told him to leave the country. Overlooking this affront in his
11926	anxiety to maintain peace, Adams dispatched to France a commission of
11927	eminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the French
11928	Republic. On their arrival, they were chagrined to find, instead of a
11929	decent reception, an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past
11930	conduct of the American government, a payment in cash, and an annual
11931	tribute as the price of continued friendship. When the news of this
11932	affair reached President Adams, he promptly laid it before Congress,
11933	referring to the Frenchmen who had made the demands as "Mr. X, Mr. Y,
11934	and Mr. Z."
11935	
11936	This insult, coupled with the fact that French privateers, like the
11937	British, were preying upon American commerce, enraged even the
11938	Republicans who had been loudest in the profession of their French
11939	sympathies. They forgot their wrath over the Jay treaty and joined with
11940	the Federalists in shouting: "Millions for defense, not a cent for
11941	tribute!" Preparations for war were made on every hand. Washington was
11942	once more called from Mount Vernon to take his old position at the head
11943	of the army. Indeed, fighting actually began upon the high seas and went
11944	on without a formal declaration of war until the year 1800. By that time
11945	the Directory had been overthrown. A treaty was readily made with
11946	Napoleon, the First Consul, who was beginning his remarkable career as
11947	chief of the French Republic, soon to be turned into an empire.
11948	
11949	=Alien and Sedition Laws.=--Flushed with success, the Federalists
11950	determined, if possible, to put an end to radical French influence in
11951	America and to silence Republican opposition. They therefore passed two
11952	drastic laws in the summer of 1798: the Alien and Sedition Acts.
11953	
11954	The first of these measures empowered the President to expel from the
11955	country or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as "dangerous" or "had
11956	reasonable grounds to suspect" of "any treasonable or secret
11957	machinations against the government."
11958	
11959	The second of the measures, the Sedition Act, penalized not only those
11960	who attempted to stir up unlawful combinations against the government
11961	but also every one who wrote, uttered, or published "any false,
11962	scandalous, and malicious writing ... against the government of the
11963	United States or either House of Congress, or the President of the
11964	United States, with intent to defame said government ... or to bring
11965	them or either of them into contempt or disrepute." This measure was
11966	hurried through Congress in spite of the opposition and the clear
11967	provision in the Constitution that Congress shall make no law abridging
11968	the freedom of speech or of the press. Even many Federalists feared the
11969	consequences of the action. Hamilton was alarmed when he read the bill,
11970	exclaiming: "Let us not establish a tyranny. Energy is a very different
11971	thing from violence." John Marshall told his friends in Virginia that,
11972	had he been in Congress, he would have opposed the two bills because he
11973	thought them "useless" and "calculated to create unnecessary discontents
11974	and jealousies."
11975	
11976	The Alien law was not enforced; but it gave great offense to the Irish
11977	and French whose activities against the American government's policy
11978	respecting Great Britain put them in danger of prison. The Sedition law,
11979	on the other hand, was vigorously applied. Several editors of Republican
11980	newspapers soon found themselves in jail or broken by ruinous fines for
11981	their caustic criticisms of the Federalist President and his policies.
11982	Bystanders at political meetings, who uttered sentiments which, though
11983	ungenerous and severe, seem harmless enough now, were hurried before
11984	Federalist judges and promptly fined and imprisoned. Although the
11985	prosecutions were not numerous, they aroused a keen resentment. The
11986	Republicans were convinced that their political opponents, having
11987	saddled upon the country Hamilton's fiscal system and the British
11988	treaty, were bent on silencing all censure. The measures therefore had
11989	exactly the opposite effect from that which their authors intended.
11990	Instead of helping the Federalist party, they made criticism of it more
11991	bitter than ever.
11992	
11993	=The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.=--Jefferson was quick to take
11994	advantage of the discontent. He drafted a set of resolutions declaring
11995	the Sedition law null and void, as violating the federal Constitution.
11996	His resolutions were passed by the Kentucky legislature late in 1798,
11997	signed by the governor, and transmitted to the other states for their
11998	consideration. Though receiving unfavorable replies from a number of
11999	Northern states, Kentucky the following year reaffirmed its position and
12000	declared that the nullification of all unconstitutional acts of Congress
12001	was the rightful remedy to be used by the states in the redress of
12002	grievances. It thus defied the federal government and announced a
12003	doctrine hostile to nationality and fraught with terrible meaning for
12004	the future. In the neighboring state of Virginia, Madison led a movement
12005	against the Alien and Sedition laws. He induced the legislature to pass
12006	resolutions condemning the acts as unconstitutional and calling upon the
12007	other states to take proper means to preserve their rights and the
12008	rights of the people.
12009	
12010	=The Republican Triumph in 1800.=--Thus the way was prepared for the
12011	election of 1800. The Republicans left no stone unturned in their
12012	efforts to place on the Federalist candidate, President Adams, all the
12013	odium of the Alien and Sedition laws, in addition to responsibility for
12014	approving Hamilton's measures and policies. The Federalists, divided in
12015	councils and cold in their affection for Adams, made a poor campaign.
12016	They tried to discredit their opponents with epithets of "Jacobins" and
12017	"Anarchists"--terms which had been weakened by excessive use. When the
12018	vote was counted, it was found that Adams had been defeated; while the
12019	Republicans had carried the entire South and New York also and secured
12020	eight of the fifteen electoral votes cast by Pennsylvania. "Our beloved
12021	Adams will now close his bright career," lamented a Federalist
12022	newspaper. "Sons of faction, demagogues and high priests of anarchy, now
12023	you have cause to triumph!"

12027	A QUARREL BETWEEN A FEDERALIST AND A REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE OF
12028	REPRESENTATIVES]
12029	
12030	Jefferson's election, however, was still uncertain. By a curious
12031	provision in the Constitution, presidential electors were required to
12032	vote for two persons without indicating which office each was to fill,
12033	the one receiving the highest number of votes to be President and the
12034	candidate standing next to be Vice President. It so happened that Aaron
12035	Burr, the Republican candidate for Vice President, had received the same
12036	number of votes as Jefferson; as neither had a majority the election was
12037	thrown into the House of Representatives, where the Federalists held the
12038	balance of power. Although it was well known that Burr was not even a
12039	candidate for President, his friends and many Federalists began
12040	intriguing for his election to that high office. Had it not been for the
12041	vigorous action of Hamilton the prize might have been snatched out of
12042	Jefferson's hands. Not until the thirty-sixth ballot on February 17,
12043	1801, was the great issue decided in his favor.[2]

12130	
12131	THE JEFFERSONIAN REPUBLICANS IN POWER
12132	
12133	
12134	REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES
12135	
12136	=Opposition to Strong Central Government.=--Cherishing especially the
12137	agricultural interest, as Jefferson said, the Republicans were in the
12138	beginning provincial in their concern and outlook. Their attachment to
12139	America was, certainly, as strong as that of Hamilton; but they regarded
12140	the state, rather than the national government, as the proper center of
12141	power and affection. Indeed, a large part of the rank and file had been
12142	among the opponents of the Constitution in the days of its adoption.
12143	Jefferson had entertained doubts about it and Monroe, destined to be the
12144	fifth President, had been one of the bitter foes of ratification. The
12145	former went so far in the direction of local autonomy that he exalted
12146	the state above the nation in the Kentucky resolutions of 1798,
12147	declaring the Constitution to be a mere compact and the states competent
12148	to interpret and nullify federal law. This was provincialism with a
12149	vengeance. "It is jealousy, not confidence, which prescribes limited
12150	constitutions," wrote Jefferson for the Kentucky legislature. Jealousy
12151	of the national government, not confidence in it--this is the ideal that
12152	reflected the provincial and agricultural interest.
12153	
12154	=Republican Simplicity.=--Every act of the Jeffersonian party during its
12155	early days of power was in accord with the ideals of government which it
12156	professed. It had opposed all pomp and ceremony, calculated to give
12157	weight and dignity to the chief executive of the nation, as symbols of
12158	monarchy and high prerogative. Appropriately, therefore, Jefferson's
12159	inauguration on March 4, 1801, the first at the new capital at
12160	Washington, was marked by extreme simplicity. In keeping with this
12161	procedure he quit the practice, followed by Washington and Adams, of
12162	reading presidential addresses to Congress in joint assembly and adopted
12163	in its stead the plan of sending his messages in writing--a custom that
12164	was continued unbroken until 1913 when President Wilson returned to the
12165	example set by the first chief magistrate.
12166	
12167	=Republican Measures.=--The Republicans had complained of a great
12168	national debt as the source of a dangerous "money power," giving
12169	strength to the federal government; accordingly they began to pay it off
12170	as rapidly as possible. They had held commerce in low esteem and looked
12171	upon a large navy as a mere device to protect it; consequently they
12172	reduced the number of warships. They had objected to excise taxes,
12173	particularly on whisky; these they quickly abolished, to the intense
12174	satisfaction of the farmers. They had protested against the heavy cost
12175	of the federal government; they reduced expenses by discharging hundreds
12176	of men from the army and abolishing many offices.
12177	
12178	They had savagely criticized the Sedition law and Jefferson refused to
12179	enforce it. They had been deeply offended by the assault on freedom of
12180	speech and press and they promptly impeached Samuel Chase, a justice of
12181	the Supreme Court, who had been especially severe in his attacks upon
12182	offenders under the Sedition Act. Their failure to convict Justice Chase
12183	by a narrow margin was due to no lack of zeal on their part but to the
12184	Federalist strength in the Senate where the trial was held. They had
12185	regarded the appointment of a large number of federal judges during the
12186	last hours of Adams' administration as an attempt to intrench
12187	Federalists in the judiciary and to enlarge the sphere of the national
12188	government. Accordingly, they at once repealed the act creating the new
12189	judgeships, thus depriving the "midnight appointees" of their posts.
12190	They had considered the federal offices, civil and military, as sources
12191	of great strength to the Federalists and Jefferson, though committed to
12192	the principle that offices should be open to all and distributed
12193	according to merit, was careful to fill most of the vacancies as they
12194	occurred with trusted Republicans. To his credit, however, it must be
12195	said that he did not make wholesale removals to find room for party
12196	workers.
12197	
12198	The Republicans thus hewed to the line of their general policy of
12199	restricting the weight, dignity, and activity of the national
12200	government. Yet there were no Republicans, as the Federalists asserted,
12201	prepared to urge serious modifications in the Constitution. "If there be
12202	any among us who wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican
12203	form," wrote Jefferson in his first inaugural, "let them stand
12204	undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may
12205	be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it." After reciting the
12206	fortunate circumstances of climate, soil, and isolation which made the
12207	future of America so full of promise, Jefferson concluded: "A wise and
12208	frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another,
12209	shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of
12210	industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the
12211	bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government; and this is
12212	necessary to close the circle of our felicities."
12213	
12214	In all this the Republicans had not reckoned with destiny. In a few
12215	short years that lay ahead it was their fate to double the territory of
12216	the country, making inevitable a continental nation; to give the
12217	Constitution a generous interpretation that shocked many a Federalist;
12218	to wage war on behalf of American commerce; to reestablish the hated
12219	United States Bank; to enact a high protective tariff; to see their
12220	Federalist opponents in their turn discredited as nullifiers and
12221	provincials; to announce high national doctrines in foreign affairs; and
12222	to behold the Constitution exalted and defended against the pretensions
12223	of states by a son of old Virginia, John Marshall, Chief Justice of the
12224	Supreme Court of the United States.
12225	
12226	
12227	THE REPUBLICANS AND THE GREAT WEST
12228	
12229	=Expansion and Land Hunger.=--The first of the great measures which
12230	drove the Republicans out upon this new national course--the purchase
12231	of the Louisiana territory--was the product of circumstances rather than
12232	of their deliberate choosing. It was not the lack of land for his
12233	cherished farmers that led Jefferson to add such an immense domain to
12234	the original possessions of the United States. In the Northwest
12235	territory, now embracing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,
12236	and a portion of Minnesota, settlements were mainly confined to the
12237	north bank of the Ohio River. To the south, in Kentucky and Tennessee,
12238	where there were more than one hundred thousand white people who had
12239	pushed over the mountains from Virginia and the Carolinas, there were
12240	still wide reaches of untilled soil. The Alabama and Mississippi regions
12241	were vast Indian frontiers of the state of Georgia, unsettled and almost
12242	unexplored. Even to the wildest imagination there seemed to be territory
12243	enough to satisfy the land hunger of the American people for a century
12244	to come.
12245	
12246	=The Significance of the Mississippi River.=--At all events the East,
12247	then the center of power, saw no good reason for expansion. The planters
12248	of the Carolinas, the manufacturers of Pennsylvania, the importers of
12249	New York, the shipbuilders of New England, looking to the seaboard and
12250	to Europe for trade, refinements, and sometimes their ideas of
12251	government, were slow to appreciate the place of the West in national
12252	economy. The better educated the Easterners were, the less, it seems,
12253	they comprehended the destiny of the nation. Sons of Federalist fathers
12254	at Williams College, after a long debate decided by a vote of fifteen to
12255	one that the purchase of Louisiana was undesirable.
12256	
12257	On the other hand, the pioneers of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee,
12258	unlearned in books, saw with their own eyes the resources of the
12259	wilderness. Many of them had been across the Mississippi and had beheld
12260	the rich lands awaiting the plow of the white man. Down the great river
12261	they floated their wheat, corn, and bacon to ocean-going ships bound for
12262	the ports of the seaboard or for Europe. The land journeys over the
12263	mountain barriers with bulky farm produce, they knew from experience,
12264	were almost impossible, and costly at best. Nails, bolts of cloth, tea,
12265	and coffee could go or come that way, but not corn and bacon. A free
12266	outlet to the sea by the Mississippi was as essential to the pioneers of
12267	the Kentucky region as the harbor of Boston to the merchant princes of
12268	that metropolis.
12269	
12270	=Louisiana under Spanish Rule.=--For this reason they watched with deep
12271	solicitude the fortunes of the Spanish king to whom, at the close of the
12272	Seven Years' War, had fallen the Louisiana territory stretching from New
12273	Orleans to the Rocky Mountains. While he controlled the mouth of the
12274	Mississippi there was little to fear, for he had neither the army nor
12275	the navy necessary to resist any invasion of American trade. Moreover,
12276	Washington had been able, by the exercise of great tact, to secure from
12277	Spain in 1795 a trading privilege through New Orleans which satisfied
12278	the present requirements of the frontiersmen even if it did not allay
12279	their fears for the future. So things stood when a swift succession of
12280	events altered the whole situation.
12281	
12282	=Louisiana Transferred to France.=--In July, 1802, a royal order from
12283	Spain instructed the officials at New Orleans to close the port to
12284	American produce. About the same time a disturbing rumor, long current,
12285	was confirmed--Napoleon had coerced Spain into returning Louisiana to
12286	France by a secret treaty signed in 1800. "The scalers of the Alps and
12287	conquerors of Venice" now looked across the sea for new scenes of
12288	adventure. The West was ablaze with excitement. A call for war ran
12289	through the frontier; expeditions were organized to prevent the landing
12290	of the French; and petitions for instant action flooded in upon
12291	Jefferson.
12292	
12293	=Jefferson Sees the Danger.=--Jefferson, the friend of France and sworn
12294	enemy of England, compelled to choose in the interest of America, never
12295	winced. "The cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France,"
12296	he wrote to Livingston, the American minister in Paris, "works sorely on
12297	the United States. It completely reverses all the political relations of
12298	the United States and will form a new epoch in our political course....
12299	There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our
12300	natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans through which the produce
12301	of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market.... France,
12302	placing herself in that door, assumes to us an attitude of defiance.
12303	Spain might have retained it quietly for years. Her pacific
12304	dispositions, her feeble state would induce her to increase our
12305	facilities there.... Not so can it ever be in the hands of France....
12306	The day that France takes possession of New Orleans fixes the sentence
12307	which is to restrain her forever within her low water mark.... It seals
12308	the union of the two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive
12309	possession of the ocean. From that moment we must marry ourselves to the
12310	British fleet and nation.... This is not a state of things we seek or
12311	desire. It is one which this measure, if adopted by France, forces on us
12312	as necessarily as any other cause by the laws of nature brings on its
12313	necessary effect."
12314	
12315	=Louisiana Purchased.=--Acting on this belief, but apparently seeing
12316	only the Mississippi outlet at stake, Jefferson sent his friend, James
12317	Monroe, to France with the power to buy New Orleans and West Florida.
12318	Before Monroe arrived, the regular minister, Livingston, had already
12319	convinced Napoleon that it would be well to sell territory which might
12320	be wrested from him at any moment by the British sea power, especially
12321	as the war, temporarily stopped by the peace of Amiens, was once more
12322	raging in Europe. Wise as he was in his day, Livingston had at first no
12323	thought of buying the whole Louisiana country. He was simply dazed when
12324	Napoleon offered to sell the entire domain and get rid of the business
12325	altogether. Though staggered by the proposal, he and Monroe decided to
12326	accept. On April 30, they signed the treaty of cession, agreeing to pay
12327	$11,250,000 in six per cent bonds and to discharge certain debts due
12328	French citizens, making in all approximately fifteen millions. Spain
12329	protested, Napoleon's brother fumed, French newspapers objected; but the
12330	deed was done.
12331	
12332	=Jefferson and His Constitutional Scruples.=--When the news of this
12333	extraordinary event reached the United States, the people were filled
12334	with astonishment, and no one was more surprised than Jefferson himself.
12335	He had thought of buying New Orleans and West Florida for a small sum,
12336	and now a vast domain had been dumped into the lap of the nation. He was
12337	puzzled. On looking into the Constitution he found not a line
12338	authorizing the purchase of more territory and so he drafted an
12339	amendment declaring "Louisiana, as ceded by France,--a part of the
12340	United States." He had belabored the Federalists for piling up a big
12341	national debt and he could hardly endure the thought of issuing more
12342	bonds himself.
12343	
12344	In the midst of his doubts came the news that Napoleon might withdraw
12345	from the bargain. Thoroughly alarmed by that, Jefferson pressed the
12346	Senate for a ratification of the treaty. He still clung to his original
12347	idea that the Constitution did not warrant the purchase; but he lamely
12348	concluded: "If our friends shall think differently, I shall certainly
12349	acquiesce with satisfaction; confident that the good sense of our
12350	country will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill
12351	effects." Thus the stanch advocate of "strict interpretation" cut loose
12352	from his own doctrine and intrusted the construction of the Constitution
12353	to "the good sense" of his countrymen.
12354	
12355	=The Treaty Ratified.=--This unusual transaction, so favorable to the
12356	West, aroused the ire of the seaboard Federalists. Some denounced it as
12357	unconstitutional, easily forgetting Hamilton's masterly defense of the
12358	bank, also not mentioned in the Constitution. Others urged that, if "the
12359	howling wilderness" ever should be settled, it would turn against the
12360	East, form new commercial connections, and escape from federal control.
12361	Still others protested that the purchase would lead inevitably to the
12362	dominance of a "hotch potch of wild men from the Far West." Federalists,
12363	who thought "the broad back of America" could readily bear Hamilton's
12364	consolidated debt, now went into agonies over a bond issue of less than
12365	one-sixth of that amount. But in vain. Jefferson's party with a high
12366	hand carried the day. The Senate, after hearing the Federalist protest,
12367	ratified the treaty. In December, 1803, the French flag was hauled down
12368	from the old government buildings in New Orleans and the Stars and
12369	Stripes were hoisted as a sign that the land of Coronado, De Soto,
12370	Marquette, and La Salle had passed forever to the United States.
12371	
12372	[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1805]
12373	
12374	By a single stroke, the original territory of the United States was more
12375	than doubled. While the boundaries of the purchase were uncertain, it is
12376	safe to say that the Louisiana territory included what is now Arkansas,
12377	Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and large
12378	portions of Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Montana, and
12379	Wyoming. The farm lands that the friends of "a little America" on the
12380	seacoast declared a hopeless wilderness were, within a hundred years,
12381	fully occupied and valued at nearly seven billion dollars--almost five
12382	hundred times the price paid to Napoleon.
12383	
12384	=Western Explorations.=--Having taken the fateful step, Jefferson wisely
12385	began to make the most of it. He prepared for the opening of the new
12386	country by sending the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore it,
12387	discover its resources, and lay out an overland route through the
12388	Missouri Valley and across the Great Divide to the Pacific. The story of
12389	this mighty exploit, which began in the spring of 1804 and ended in the
12390	autumn of 1806, was set down with skill and pains in the journal of
12391	Lewis and Clark; when published even in a short form, it invited the
12392	forward-looking men of the East to take thought about the western
12393	empire. At the same time Zebulon Pike, in a series of journeys, explored
12394	the sources of the Mississippi River and penetrated the Spanish
12395	territories of the far Southwest. Thus scouts and pioneers continued the
12396	work of diplomats.
12397	
12398	
12399	THE REPUBLICAN WAR FOR COMMERCIAL INDEPENDENCE
12400	
12401	=The English and French Blockades.=--In addition to bringing Louisiana
12402	to the United States, the reopening of the European War in 1803, after a
12403	short lull, renewed in an acute form the commercial difficulties that
12404	had plagued the country all during the administrations of Washington and
12405	Adams. The Republicans were now plunged into the hornets' nest. The
12406	party whose ardent spirits had burned Jay in effigy, stoned Hamilton for
12407	defending his treaty, jeered Washington's proclamation of neutrality,
12408	and spoken bitterly of "timid traders," could no longer take refuge in
12409	criticism. It had to act.
12410	
12411	Its troubles took a serious turn in 1806. England, in a determined
12412	effort to bring France to her knees by starvation, declared the coast of
12413	Europe blockaded from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe River. Napoleon
12414	retaliated by his Berlin Decree of November, 1806, blockading the
12415	British Isles--a measure terrifying to American ship owners whose
12416	vessels were liable to seizure by any French rover, though Napoleon had
12417	no navy to make good his proclamation. Great Britain countered with a
12418	still more irritating decree--the Orders in Council of 1807. It modified
12419	its blockade, but in so doing merely authorized American ships not
12420	carrying munitions of war to complete their voyage to the Continent, on
12421	condition of their stopping at a British port, securing a license, and
12422	paying a tax. This, responded Napoleon, was the height of insolence, and
12423	he denounced it as a gross violation of international law. He then
12424	closed the circle of American troubles by issuing his Milan Decree of
12425	December, 1807. This order declared that any ship which complied with
12426	the British rules would be subject to seizure and confiscation by French
12427	authorities.
12428	
12429	=The Impressment of Seamen.=--That was not all. Great Britain, in dire
12430	need of men for her navy, adopted the practice of stopping American
12431	ships, searching them, and carrying away British-born sailors found on
12432	board. British sailors were so badly treated, so cruelly flogged for
12433	trivial causes, and so meanly fed that they fled in crowds to the
12434	American marine. In many cases it was difficult to tell whether seamen
12435	were English or American. They spoke the same language, so that language
12436	was no test. Rovers on the deep and stragglers in the ports of both
12437	countries, they frequently had no papers to show their nativity.
12438	Moreover, Great Britain held to the old rule--"Once an Englishman,
12439	always an Englishman"--a doctrine rejected by the United States in
12440	favor of the principle that a man could choose the nation to which he
12441	would give allegiance. British sea captains, sometimes by mistake, and
12442	often enough with reckless indifference, carried away into servitude in
12443	their own navy genuine American citizens. The process itself, even when
12444	executed with all the civilities of law, was painful enough, for it
12445	meant that American ships were forced to "come to," and compelled to
12446	rest submissively under British guns until the searching party had pried
12447	into records, questioned seamen, seized and handcuffed victims. Saints
12448	could not have done this work without raising angry passions, and only
12449	saints could have endured it with patience and fortitude.
12450	
12451	Had the enactment of the scenes been confined to the high seas and
12452	knowledge of them to rumors and newspaper stories, American resentment
12453	might not have been so intense; but many a search and seizure was made
12454	in sight of land. British and French vessels patrolled the coasts,
12455	firing on one another and chasing one another in American waters within
12456	the three-mile limit. When, in the summer of 1807, the American frigate
12457	_Chesapeake_ refused to surrender men alleged to be deserters from King
12458	George's navy, the British warship _Leopard_ opened fire, killing three
12459	men and wounding eighteen more--an act which even the British ministry
12460	could hardly excuse. If the French were less frequently the offenders,
12461	it was not because of their tenderness about American rights but because
12462	so few of their ships escaped the hawk-eyed British navy to operate in
12463	American waters.
12464	
12465	=The Losses in American Commerce.=--This high-handed conduct on the part
12466	of European belligerents was very injurious to American trade. By their
12467	enterprise, American shippers had become the foremost carriers on the
12468	Atlantic Ocean. In a decade they had doubled the tonnage of American
12469	merchant ships under the American flag, taking the place of the French
12470	marine when Britain swept that from the seas, and supplying Britain with
12471	the sinews of war for the contest with the Napoleonic empire. The
12472	American shipping engaged in foreign trade embraced 363,110 tons in
12473	1791; 669,921 tons in 1800; and almost 1,000,000 tons in 1810. Such was
12474	the enterprise attacked by the British and French decrees. American
12475	ships bound for Great Britain were liable to be captured by French
12476	privateers which, in spite of the disasters of the Nile and Trafalgar,
12477	ranged the seas. American ships destined for the Continent, if they
12478	failed to stop at British ports and pay tribute, were in great danger of
12479	capture by the sleepless British navy and its swarm of auxiliaries.
12480	American sea captains who, in fear of British vengeance, heeded the
12481	Orders in Council and paid the tax were almost certain to fall a prey to
12482	French vengeance, for the French were vigorous in executing the Milan
12483	Decree.
12484	
12485	=Jefferson's Policy.=--The President's dilemma was distressing. Both the
12486	belligerents in Europe were guilty of depredations on American commerce.
12487	War on both of them was out of the question. War on France was
12488	impossible because she had no territory on this side of the water which
12489	could be reached by American troops and her naval forces had been
12490	shattered at the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar. War on Great
12491	Britain, a power which Jefferson's followers feared and distrusted, was
12492	possible but not inviting. Jefferson shrank from it. A man of peace, he
12493	disliked war's brazen clamor; a man of kindly spirit, he was startled at
12494	the death and destruction which it brought in its train. So for the
12495	eight years Jefferson steered an even course, suggesting measure after
12496	measure with a view to avoiding bloodshed. He sent, it is true,
12497	Commodore Preble in 1803 to punish Mediterranean pirates preying upon
12498	American commerce; but a great war he evaded with passionate
12499	earnestness, trying in its place every other expedient to protect
12500	American rights.
12501	
12502	=The Embargo and Non-intercourse Acts.=--In 1806, Congress passed and
12503	Jefferson approved a non-importation act closing American ports to
12504	certain products from British dominions--a measure intended as a club
12505	over the British government's head. This law, failing in its purpose,
12506	Jefferson proposed and Congress adopted in December, 1807, the Embargo
12507	Act forbidding all vessels to leave American harbors for foreign ports.
12508	France and England were to be brought to terms by cutting off their
12509	supplies.
12510	
12511	The result of the embargo was pathetic. England and France refused to
12512	give up search and seizure. American ship owners who, lured by huge
12513	profits, had formerly been willing to take the risk were now restrained
12514	by law to their home ports. Every section suffered. The South and West
12515	found their markets for cotton, rice, tobacco, corn, and bacon
12516	curtailed. Thus they learned by bitter experience the national
12517	significance of commerce. Ship masters, ship builders, longshoremen, and
12518	sailors were thrown out of employment while the prices of foreign goods
12519	doubled. Those who obeyed the law were ruined; violators of the law
12520	smuggled goods into Canada and Florida for shipment abroad.
12521	
12522	Jefferson's friends accepted the medicine with a wry face as the only
12523	alternative to supine submission or open war. His opponents, without
12524	offering any solution of their own, denounced it as a contemptible plan
12525	that brought neither relief nor honor. Beset by the clamor that arose on
12526	all sides, Congress, in the closing days of Jefferson's administration,
12527	repealed the Embargo law and substituted a Non-intercourse act
12528	forbidding trade with England and France while permitting it with other
12529	countries--a measure equally futile in staying the depredations on
12530	American shipping.
12531	
12532	=Jefferson Retires in Favor of Madison.=--Jefferson, exhausted by
12533	endless wrangling and wounded, as Washington had been, by savage
12534	criticism, welcomed March 4, 1809. His friends urged him to "stay by the
12535	ship" and accept a third term. He declined, saying that election for
12536	life might result from repeated reelection. In following Washington's
12537	course and defending it on principle, he set an example to all his
12538	successors, making the "third term doctrine" a part of American
12539	unwritten law.
12540	
12541	His intimate friend, James Madison, to whom he turned over the burdens
12542	of his high office was, like himself, a man of peace. Madison had been a
12543	leader since the days of the Revolution, but in legislative halls and
12544	council chambers, not on the field of battle. Small in stature,
12545	sensitive in feelings, studious in habits, he was no man for the rough
12546	and tumble of practical politics. He had taken a prominent and
12547	distinguished part in the framing and the adoption of the Constitution.
12548	He had served in the first Congress as a friend of Hamilton's measures.
12549	Later he attached himself to Jefferson's fortunes and served for eight
12550	years as his first counselor, the Secretary of State. The principles of
12551	the Constitution, which he had helped to make and interpret, he was now
12552	as President called upon to apply in one of the most perplexing moments
12553	in all American history. In keeping with his own traditions and
12554	following in the footsteps of Jefferson, he vainly tried to solve the
12555	foreign problem by negotiation.
12556	
12557	=The Trend of Events.=--Whatever difficulties Madison had in making up
12558	his mind on war and peace were settled by events beyond his own control.
12559	In the spring of 1811, a British frigate held up an American ship near
12560	the harbor of New York and impressed a seaman alleged to be an American
12561	citizen. Burning with resentment, the captain of the _President_, an
12562	American warship, acting under orders, poured several broadsides into
12563	the _Little Belt_, a British sloop, suspected of being the guilty party.
12564	The British also encouraged the Indian chief Tecumseh, who welded
12565	together the Indians of the Northwest under British protection and gave
12566	signs of restlessness presaging a revolt. This sent a note of alarm
12567	along the frontier that was not checked even when, in November,
12568	Tecumseh's men were badly beaten at Tippecanoe by William Henry
12569	Harrison. The Indians stood in the way of the advancing frontier, and it
12570	seemed to the pioneers that, without support from the British in Canada,
12571	the Red Men would soon be subdued.
12572	
12573	=Clay and Calhoun.=--While events were moving swiftly and rumors were
12574	flying thick and fast, the mastery of the government passed from the
12575	uncertain hands of Madison to a party of ardent young men in Congress,
12576	dubbed "Young Republicans," under the leadership of two members destined
12577	to be mighty figures in American history: Henry Clay of Kentucky and
12578	John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The former contended, in a flair of
12579	folly, that "the militia of Kentucky alone are competent to place
12580	Montreal and Upper Canada at your feet." The latter with a light heart
12581	spoke of conquering Canada in a four weeks' campaign. "It must not be
12582	inferred," says Channing, "that in advocating conquest, the Westerners
12583	were actuated merely by desire for land; they welcomed war because they
12584	
12585	thought it would be the easiest way to abate Indian troubles. The
12586	savages were supported by the fur-trading interests that centred at
12587	Quebec and London.... The Southerners on their part wished for Florida
12588	and they thought that the conquest of Canada would obviate some Northern
12589	opposition to this acquisition of slave territory." While Clay and
12590	Calhoun, spokesmen of the West and South, were not unmindful of what
12591	Napoleon had done to American commerce, they knew that their followers
12592	still remembered with deep gratitude the aid of the French in the war
12593	for independence and that the embers of the old hatred for George III,
12594	still on the throne, could be readily blown into flame.
12595	
12596	=Madison Accepts War as Inevitable.=--The conduct of the British
12597	ministers with whom Madison had to deal did little to encourage him in
12598	adhering to the policy of "watchful waiting." One of them, a high Tory,
12599	believed that all Americans were alike "except that a few are less
12600	knaves than others" and his methods were colored by his belief. On the
12601	recall of this minister the British government selected another no less
12602	high and mighty in his principles and opinions. So Madison became
12603	thoroughly discouraged about the outcome of pacific measures. When the
12604	pressure from Congress upon him became too heavy, he gave way, signing
12605	on June 18, 1812, the declaration of war on Great Britain. In
12606	proclaiming hostilities, the administration set forth the causes which
12607	justified the declaration; namely, the British had been encouraging the
12608	Indians to attack American citizens on the frontier; they had ruined
12609	American trade by blockades; they had insulted the American flag by
12610	stopping and searching our ships; they had illegally seized American
12611	sailors and driven them into the British navy.
12612	
12613	=The Course of the War.=--The war lasted for nearly three years without
12614	bringing victory to either side. The surrender of Detroit by General
12615	Hull to the British and the failure of the American invasion of Canada
12616	were offset by Perry's victory on Lake Erie and a decisive blow
12617	administered to British designs for an invasion of New York by way of
12618	Plattsburgh. The triumph of Jackson at New Orleans helped to atone for
12619	the humiliation suffered in the burning of the Capitol by the British.
12620	The stirring deeds of the _Constitution_, the _United States_, and the
12621	_Argus_ on the seas, the heroic death of Lawrence and the victories of a
12622	hundred privateers furnished consolation for those who suffered from the
12623	iron blockade finally established by the British government when it came
12624	to appreciate the gravity of the situation. While men love the annals of
12625	the sea, they will turn to the running battles, the narrow escapes, and
12626	the reckless daring of American sailors in that naval contest with Great
12627	Britain.
12628	
12629	All this was exciting but it was inconclusive. In fact, never was a
12630	government less prepared than was that of the United States in 1812. It
12631	had neither the disciplined troops, the ships of war, nor the supplies
12632	required by the magnitude of the military task. It was fortune that
12633	favored the American cause. Great Britain, harassed, worn, and
12634	financially embarrassed by nearly twenty years of fighting in Europe,
12635	was in no mood to gather her forces for a titanic effort in America even
12636	after Napoleon was overthrown and sent into exile at Elba in the spring
12637	of 1814. War clouds still hung on the European horizon and the conflict
12638	temporarily halted did again break out. To be rid of American anxieties
12639	and free for European eventualities, England was ready to settle with
12640	the United States, especially as that could be done without conceding
12641	anything or surrendering any claims.
12642	
12643	=The Treaty of Peace.=--Both countries were in truth sick of a war that
12644	offered neither glory nor profit. Having indulged in the usual
12645	diplomatic skirmishing, they sent representatives to Ghent to discuss
12646	terms of peace. After long negotiations an agreement was reached on
12647	Christmas eve, 1814, a few days before Jackson's victory at New Orleans.
12648	When the treaty reached America the people were surprised to find that
12649	it said nothing about the seizure of American sailors, the destruction
12650	of American trade, the searching of American ships, or the support of
12651	Indians on the frontier. Nevertheless, we are told, the people "passed
12652	from gloom to glory" when the news of peace arrived. The bells were
12653	rung; schools were closed; flags were displayed; and many a rousing
12654	toast was drunk in tavern and private home. The rejoicing could
12655	continue. With Napoleon definitely beaten at Waterloo in June, 1815,
12656	Great Britain had no need to impress sailors, search ships, and
12657	confiscate American goods bound to the Continent. Once more the terrible
12658	sea power sank into the background and the ocean was again white with
12659	the sails of merchantmen.
12660	
12661	
12662	THE REPUBLICANS NATIONALIZED
12663	
12664	=The Federalists Discredited.=--By a strange turn of fortune's wheel,
12665	the party of Hamilton, Washington, Adams, the party of the grand nation,
12666	became the party of provincialism and nullification. New England,
12667	finding its shipping interests crippled in the European conflict and
12668	then penalized by embargoes, opposed the declaration of war on Great
12669	Britain, which meant the completion of the ruin already begun. In the
12670	course of the struggle, the Federalist leaders came perilously near to
12671	treason in their efforts to hamper the government of the United States;
12672	and in their desperation they fell back upon the doctrine of
12673	nullification so recently condemned by them when it came from Kentucky.
12674	The Senate of Massachusetts, while the war was in progress, resolved
12675	that it was waged "without justifiable cause," and refused to approve
12676	military and naval projects not connected with "the defense of our
12677	seacoast and soil." A Boston newspaper declared that the union was
12678	nothing but a treaty among sovereign states, that states could decide
12679	for themselves the question of obeying federal law, and that armed
12680	resistance under the banner of a state would not be rebellion or
12681	treason. The general assembly of Connecticut reminded the administration
12682	at Washington that "the state of Connecticut is a free, sovereign, and
12683	independent state." Gouverneur Morris, a member of the convention which
12684	had drafted the Constitution, suggested the holding of another
12685	conference to consider whether the Northern states should remain in the
12686	union.
12687	
12688	[Illustration: _From an old cartoon_
12689	
12690	NEW ENGLAND JUMPING INTO THE HANDS OF GEORGE III]
12691	
12692	In October, 1814, a convention of delegates from Connecticut,
12693	Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and certain counties of New Hampshire and
12694	Vermont was held at Hartford, on the call of Massachusetts. The counsels
12695	of the extremists were rejected but the convention solemnly went on
12696	record to the effect that acts of Congress in violation of the
12697	Constitution are void; that in cases of deliberate, dangerous, and
12698	palpable infractions the state is duty bound to interpose its authority
12699	for the protection of its citizens; and that when emergencies occur the
12700	states must be their own judges and execute their own decisions. Thus
12701	New England answered the challenge of Calhoun and Clay. Fortunately its
12702	actions were not as rash as its words. The Hartford convention merely
12703	proposed certain amendments to the Constitution and adjourned. At the
12704	close of the war, its proposals vanished harmlessly; but the men who
12705	made them were hopelessly discredited.
12706	
12707	=The Second United States Bank.=--In driving the Federalists towards
12708	nullification and waging a national war themselves, the Republicans lost
12709	all their old taint of provincialism. Moreover, in turning to measures
12710	of reconstruction called forth by the war, they resorted to the national
12711	devices of the Federalists. In 1816, they chartered for a period of
12712	twenty years a second United States Bank--the institution which
12713	Jefferson and Madison once had condemned as unsound and
12714	unconstitutional. The Constitution remained unchanged; times and
12715	circumstances had changed. Calhoun dismissed the vexed question of
12716	constitutionality with a scant reference to an ancient dispute, while
12717	Madison set aside his scruples and signed the bill.
12718	
12719	=The Protective Tariff of 1816.=--The Republicans supplemented the Bank
12720	by another Federalist measure--a high protective tariff. Clay viewed it
12721	as the beginning of his "American system" of protection. Calhoun
12722	defended it on national principles. For this sudden reversal of policy
12723	the young Republicans were taunted by some of their older party
12724	colleagues with betraying the "agricultural interest" that Jefferson had
12725	fostered; but Calhoun refused to listen to their criticisms. "When the
12726	seas are open," he said, "the produce of the South may pour anywhere
12727	into the markets of the Old World.... What are the effects of a war with
12728	a maritime power--with England? Our commerce annihilated ... our
12729	agriculture cut off from its accustomed markets, the surplus of the
12730	farmer perishes on his hands.... The recent war fell with peculiar
12731	pressure on the growers of cotton and tobacco and the other great
12732	staples of the country; and the same state of things will recur in the
12733	event of another war unless prevented by the foresight of this body....
12734	When our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon
12735	will be under the fostering care of the government, we shall no longer
12736	experience these evils." With the Republicans nationalized, the
12737	Federalist party, as an organization, disappeared after a crushing
12738	defeat in the presidential campaign of 1816.
12739	
12740	=Monroe and the Florida Purchase.=--To the victor in that political
12741	contest, James Monroe of Virginia, fell two tasks of national
12742	importance, adding to the prestige of the whole country and deepening
12743	the sense of patriotism that weaned men away from mere allegiance to
12744	states. The first of these was the purchase of Florida from Spain. The
12745	acquisition of Louisiana let the Mississippi flow "unvexed to the sea";
12746	but it left all the states east of the river cut off from the Gulf,
12747	affording them ground for discontent akin to that which had moved the
12748	pioneers of Kentucky to action a generation earlier. The uncertainty as
12749	to the boundaries of Louisiana gave the United States a claim to West
12750	Florida, setting on foot a movement for occupation. The Florida swamps
12751	were a basis for Indian marauders who periodically swept into the
12752	frontier settlements, and hiding places for runaway slaves. Thus the
12753	sanction of international law was given to punitive expeditions into
12754	alien territory.
12755	
12756	The pioneer leaders stood waiting for the signal. It came. President
12757	Monroe, on the occasion of an Indian outbreak, ordered General Jackson
12758	to seize the offenders, in the Floridas, if necessary. The high-spirited
12759	warrior, taking this as a hint that he was to occupy the coveted region,
12760	replied that, if possession was the object of the invasion, he could
12761	occupy the Floridas within sixty days. Without waiting for an answer to
12762	this letter, he launched his expedition, and in the spring of 1818 was
12763	master of the Spanish king's domain to the south.
12764	
12765	There was nothing for the king to do but to make the best of the
12766	inevitable by ceding the Floridas to the United States in return for
12767	five million dollars to be paid to American citizens having claims
12768	against Spain. On Washington's birthday, 1819, the treaty was signed. It
12769	ceded the Floridas to the United States and defined the boundary between
12770	Mexico and the United States by drawing a line from the mouth of the
12771	Sabine River in a northwesterly direction to the Pacific. On this
12772	occasion even Monroe, former opponent of the Constitution, forgot to
12773	inquire whether new territory could be constitutionally acquired and
12774	incorporated into the American union. The Republicans seemed far away
12775	from the days of "strict construction." And Jefferson still lived!
12776	
12777	=The Monroe Doctrine.=--Even more effective in fashioning the national
12778	idea was Monroe's enunciation of the famous doctrine that bears his
12779	name. The occasion was another European crisis. During the Napoleonic
12780	upheaval and the years of dissolution that ensued, the Spanish colonies
12781	in America, following the example set by their English neighbors in
12782	1776, declared their independence. Unable to conquer them alone, the
12783	king of Spain turned for help to the friendly powers of Europe that
12784	looked upon revolution and republics with undisguised horror.
12785	
12786	_The Holy Alliance._--He found them prepared to view his case with
12787	sympathy. Three of them, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, under the
12788	leadership of the Czar, Alexander I, in the autumn of 1815, had entered
12789	into a Holy Alliance to sustain by reciprocal service the autocratic
12790	principle in government. Although the effusive, almost maudlin, language
12791	of the treaty did not express their purpose explicitly, the Alliance was
12792	later regarded as a mere union of monarchs to prevent the rise and
12793	growth of popular government.
12794	
12795	The American people thought their worst fears confirmed when, in 1822, a
12796	conference of delegates from Russia, Austria, Prussia, and France met at
12797	Verona to consider, among other things, revolutions that had just broken
12798	out in Spain and Italy. The spirit of the conference is reflected in the
12799	first article of the agreement reached by the delegates: "The high
12800	contracting powers, being convinced that the system of representative
12801	government is equally incompatible with the monarchical principle and
12802	the maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right,
12803	mutually engage in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to
12804	put an end to the system of representative government in whatever
12805	country it may exist in Europe and to prevent its being introduced in
12806	those countries where it is not yet known." The Czar, who incidentally
12807	coveted the west coast of North America, proposed to send an army to aid
12808	the king of Spain in his troubles at home, thus preparing the way for
12809	intervention in Spanish America. It was material weakness not want of
12810	spirit, that prevented the grand union of monarchs from making open war
12811	on popular government.
12812	
12813	_The Position of England._--Unfortunately, too, for the Holy Alliance,
12814	England refused to cooperate. English merchants had built up a large
12815	trade with the independent Latin-American colonies and they protested
12816	against the restoration of Spanish sovereignty, which meant a renewal of
12817	Spain's former trade monopoly. Moreover, divine right doctrines had been
12818	laid to rest in England and the representative principle thoroughly
12819	established. Already there were signs of the coming democratic flood
12820	which was soon to carry the first reform bill of 1832, extending the
12821	suffrage, and sweep on to even greater achievements. British statesmen,
12822	therefore, had to be cautious. In such circumstances, instead of
12823	cooperating with the autocrats of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, they
12824	turned to the minister of the United States in London. The British prime
12825	minister, Canning, proposed that the two countries join in declaring
12826	their unwillingness to see the Spanish colonies transferred to any other
12827	power.
12828	
12829	_Jefferson's Advice._--The proposal was rejected; but President Monroe
12830	took up the suggestion with Madison and Jefferson as well as with his
12831	Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams. They favored the plan. Jefferson
12832	said: "One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit [of
12833	freedom]; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By
12834	acceding to her proposition we detach her from the bands, bring her
12835	mighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a
12836	continent at one stroke.... With her on our side we need not fear the
12837	whole world. With her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial
12838	friendship."
12839	
12840	_Monroe's Statement of the Doctrine._--Acting on the advice of trusted
12841	friends, President Monroe embodied in his message to Congress, on
12842	December 2, 1823, a statement of principles now famous throughout the
12843	world as the Monroe Doctrine. To the autocrats of Europe he announced
12844	that he would regard "any attempt on their part to extend their system
12845	to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety."
12846	While he did not propose to interfere with existing colonies dependent
12847	on European powers, he ranged himself squarely on the side of those that
12848	had declared their independence. Any attempt by a European power to
12849	oppress them or control their destiny in any manner he characterized as
12850	"a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States."
12851	Referring in another part of his message to a recent claim which the
12852	Czar had made to the Pacific coast, President Monroe warned the Old
12853	World that "the American continents, by the free and independent
12854	condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to
12855	be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European
12856	powers." The effect of this declaration was immediate and profound. Men
12857	whose political horizon had been limited to a community or state were
12858	led to consider their nation as a great power among the sovereignties of
12859	the earth, taking its part in shaping their international relations.
12860	
12861	=The Missouri Compromise.=--Respecting one other important measure of
12862	this period, the Republicans also took a broad view of their obligations
12863	under the Constitution; namely, the Missouri Compromise. It is true,
12864	they insisted on the admission of Missouri as a slave state, balanced
12865	against the free state of Maine; but at the same time they assented to
12866	the prohibition of slavery in the Louisiana territory north of the line
12867	36 o 30'. During the debate on the subject an extreme view had been
12868	presented, to the effect that Congress had no constitutional warrant for
12869	abolishing slavery in the territories. The precedent of the Northwest
12870	Ordinance, ratified by Congress in 1789, seemed a conclusive answer from
12871	practice to this contention; but Monroe submitted the issue to his
12872	cabinet, which included Calhoun of South Carolina, Crawford of Georgia,
12873	and Wirt of Virginia, all presumably adherents to the Jeffersonian
12874	principle of strict construction. He received in reply a unanimous
12875	verdict to the effect that Congress did have the power to prohibit
12876	slavery in the territories governed by it. Acting on this advice he
12877	approved, on March 6, 1820, the bill establishing freedom north of the
12878	compromise line. This generous interpretation of the powers of Congress
12879	stood for nearly forty years, until repudiated by the Supreme Court in
12880	the Dred Scott case.
12881	
12882	
12883	THE NATIONAL DECISIONS OF CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL
12884	
12885	=John Marshall, the Nationalist.=--The Republicans in the lower ranges
12886	of state politics, who did not catch the grand national style of their
12887	leaders charged with responsibilities in the national field, were
12888	assisted in their education by a Federalist from the Old Dominion, John
12889	Marshall, who, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
12890	States from 1801 to 1835, lost no occasion to exalt the Constitution
12891	above the claims of the provinces. No differences of opinion as to his
12892	political views have ever led even his warmest opponents to deny his
12893	superb abilities or his sincere devotion to the national idea. All will
12894	likewise agree that for talents, native and acquired, he was an ornament
12895	to the humble democracy that brought him forth. His whole career was
12896	American. Born on the frontier of Virginia, reared in a log cabin,
12897	granted only the barest rudiments of education, inured to hardship and
12898	rough life, he rose by masterly efforts to the highest judicial honor
12899	America can bestow.
12900	
12901	On him the bitter experience of the Revolution and of later days made a
12902	lasting impression. He was no "summer patriot." He had been a soldier in
12903	the Revolutionary army. He had suffered with Washington at Valley Forge.
12904	He had seen his comrades in arms starving and freezing because the
12905	Continental Congress had neither the power nor the inclination to force
12906	the states to do their full duty. To him the Articles of Confederation
12907	were the symbol of futility. Into the struggle for the formation of the
12908	Constitution and its ratification in Virginia he had thrown himself with
12909	the ardor of a soldier. Later, as a member of Congress, a representative
12910	to France, and Secretary of State, he had aided the Federalists in
12911	establishing the new government. When at length they were driven from
12912	power in the executive and legislative branches of the government, he
12913	was chosen for their last stronghold, the Supreme Court. By historic
12914	irony he administered the oath of office to his bitterest enemy, Thomas
12915	Jefferson; and, long after the author of the Declaration of Independence
12916	had retired to private life, the stern Chief Justice continued to
12917	announce the old Federalist principles from the Supreme Bench.
12918	
12919	[Illustration: JOHN MARSHALL]
12920	
12921	=Marbury _vs._ Madison--An Act of Congress Annulled.=--He had been in
12922	his high office only two years when he laid down for the first time in
12923	the name of the entire Court the doctrine that the judges have the power
12924	to declare an act of Congress null and void when in their opinion it
12925	violates the Constitution. This power was not expressly conferred on the
12926	Court. Though many able men held that the judicial branch of the
12927	government enjoyed it, the principle was not positively established
12928	until 1803 when the case of Marbury _vs._ Madison was decided. In
12929	rendering the opinion of the Court, Marshall cited no precedents. He
12930	sought no foundations for his argument in ancient history. He rested it
12931	on the general nature of the American system. The Constitution, ran his
12932	reasoning, is the supreme law of the land; it limits and binds all who
12933	act in the name of the United States; it limits the powers of Congress
12934	and defines the rights of citizens. If Congress can ignore its
12935	limitations and trespass upon the rights of citizens, Marshall argued,
12936	then the Constitution disappears and Congress is supreme. Since,
12937	however, the Constitution is supreme and superior to Congress, it is the
12938	duty of judges, under their oath of office, to sustain it against
12939	measures which violate it. Therefore, from the nature of the American
12940	constitutional system the courts must declare null and void all acts
12941	which are not authorized. "A law repugnant to the Constitution," he
12942	closed, "is void and the courts as well as other departments are bound
12943	by that instrument." From that day to this the practice of federal and
12944	state courts in passing upon the constitutionality of laws has remained
12945	unshaken.
12946	
12947	This doctrine was received by Jefferson and many of his followers with
12948	consternation. If the idea was sound, he exclaimed, "then indeed is our
12949	Constitution a complete _felo de se_ [legally, a suicide]. For,
12950	intending to establish three departments, coordinate and independent
12951	that they might check and balance one another, it has given, according
12952	to this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for
12953	the government of the others, and to that one, too, which is unelected
12954	by and independent of the nation.... The Constitution, on this
12955	hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which
12956	they may twist and shape into any form they please. It should be
12957	remembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever
12958	power in any government is independent, is absolute also.... A judiciary
12959	independent of a king or executive alone is a good thing; but
12960	independence of the will of the nation is a solecism, at least in a
12961	republican government." But Marshall was mighty and his view prevailed,
12962	though from time to time other men, clinging to Jefferson's opinion,
12963	likewise opposed the exercise by the Courts of the high power of passing
12964	upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress.
12965	
12966	=Acts of State Legislatures Declared Unconstitutional.=--Had Marshall
12967	stopped with annulling an act of Congress, he would have heard less
12968	criticism from Republican quarters; but, with the same firmness, he set
12969	aside acts of state legislatures as well, whenever, in his opinion, they
12970	violated the federal Constitution. In 1810, in the case of Fletcher
12971	_vs._ Peck, he annulled an act of the Georgia legislature, informing the
12972	state that it was not sovereign, but "a part of a large empire, ... a
12973	member of the American union; and that union has a constitution ...
12974	which imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states." In the
12975	case of McCulloch _vs._ Maryland, decided in 1819, he declared void an
12976	act of the Maryland legislature designed to paralyze the branches of the
12977	United States Bank established in that state. In the same year, in the
12978	still more memorable Dartmouth College case, he annulled an act of the
12979	New Hampshire legislature which infringed upon the charter received by
12980	the college from King George long before. That charter, he declared, was
12981	a contract between the state and the college, which the legislature
12982	under the federal Constitution could not impair. Two years later he
12983	stirred the wrath of Virginia by summoning her to the bar of the Supreme
12984	Court to answer in a case in which the validity of one of her laws was
12985	involved and then justified his action in a powerful opinion rendered in
12986	the case of Cohens _vs._ Virginia.
12987	
12988	All these decisions aroused the legislatures of the states. They passed
12989	sheaves of resolutions protesting and condemning; but Marshall never
12990	turned and never stayed. The Constitution of the United States, he
12991	fairly thundered at them, is the supreme law of the land; the Supreme
12992	Court is the proper tribunal to pass finally upon the validity of the
12993	laws of the states; and "those sovereignties," far from possessing the
12994	right of review and nullification, are irrevocably bound by the
12995	decisions of that Court. This was strong medicine for the authors of the
12996	Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions and for the members of the Hartford
12997	convention; but they had to take it.
12998	
12999	=The Doctrine of Implied Powers.=--While restraining Congress in the
13000	Marbury case and the state legislatures in a score of cases, Marshall
13001	also laid the judicial foundation for a broad and liberal view of the
13002	Constitution as opposed to narrow and strict construction. In McCulloch
13003	_vs._ Maryland, he construed generously the words "necessary and proper"
13004	in such a way as to confer upon Congress a wide range of "implied
13005	powers" in addition to their express powers. That case involved, among
13006	other things, the question whether the act establishing the second
13007	United States Bank was authorized by the Constitution. Marshall answered
13008	in the affirmative. Congress, ran his reasoning, has large powers over
13009	taxation and the currency; a bank is of appropriate use in the exercise
13010	of these enumerated powers; and therefore, though not absolutely
13011	necessary, a bank is entirely proper and constitutional. "With respect
13012	to the means by which the powers that the Constitution confers are to be
13013	carried into execution," he said, Congress must be allowed the
13014	discretion which "will enable that body to perform the high duties
13015	assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people." In short,
13016	the Constitution of the United States is not a strait jacket but a
13017	flexible instrument vesting in Congress the powers necessary to meet
13018	national problems as they arise. In delivering this opinion Marshall
13019	used language almost identical with that employed by Lincoln when,
13020	standing on the battle field of a war waged to preserve the nation, he
13021	said that "a government of the people, by the people, for the people
13022	shall not perish from the earth."
13023	
13024	
13025	SUMMARY OF THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS
13026	
13027	During the strenuous period between the establishment of American
13028	independence and the advent of Jacksonian democracy the great American
13029	experiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it. All
13030	the Presidents in that period, except John Quincy Adams, had taken part
13031	in the Revolution. James Madison, the chief author of the Constitution,
13032	lived until 1836. This age, therefore, was the "age of the fathers." It
13033	saw the threatened ruin of the country under the Articles of
13034	Confederation, the formation of the Constitution, the rise of political
13035	parties, the growth of the West, the second war with England, and the
13036	apparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism.
13037	
13038	The new republic had hardly been started in 1783 before its troubles
13039	began. The government could not raise money to pay its debts or running
13040	expenses; it could not protect American commerce and manufactures
13041	against European competition; it could not stop the continual issues of
13042	paper money by the states; it could not intervene to put down domestic
13043	uprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments.
13044	Without money, without an army, without courts of law, the union under
13045	the Articles of Confederation was drifting into dissolution. Patriots,
13046	who had risked their lives for independence, began to talk of monarchy
13047	again. Washington, Hamilton, and Madison insisted that a new
13048	constitution alone could save America from disaster.
13049	
13050	By dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced
13051	the Congress to call a national convention to take into account the
13052	state of America. In May, 1787, it assembled at Philadelphia and for
13053	months it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution. The small
13054	states clamored for equal rights in the union. The large states vowed
13055	that they would never grant it. A spirit of conciliation, fair play, and
13056	compromise saved the convention from breaking up. In addition, there
13057	were jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states.
13058	Here, too, compromises had to be worked out. Some of the delegates
13059	feared the growth of democracy and others cherished it. These factions
13060	also had to be placated. At last a plan of government was drafted--the
13061	Constitution of the United States--and submitted to the states for
13062	approval. Only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states
13063	ratify the instrument to put it into effect. On April 30, 1789, George
13064	Washington was inaugurated first President.
13065	
13066	The new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation, assume
13067	the debts of the states, found a national bank, lay heavy taxes to pay
13068	the bills, and enact laws protecting American industry and commerce.
13069	Hamilton led the way, but he had not gone far before he encountered
13070	opposition. He found a formidable antagonist in Jefferson. In time two
13071	political parties appeared full armed upon the scene: the Federalists
13072	and the Republicans. For ten years they filled the country with
13073	political debate. In 1800 the Federalists were utterly vanquished by the
13074	Republicans with Jefferson in the lead.
13075	
13076	By their proclamations of faith the Republicans favored the states
13077	rather than the new national government, but in practice they added
13078	immensely to the prestige and power of the nation. They purchased
13079	Louisiana from France, they waged a war for commercial independence
13080	against England, they created a second United States Bank, they enacted
13081	the protective tariff of 1816, they declared that Congress had power to
13082	abolish slavery north of the Missouri Compromise line, and they spread
13083	the shield of the Monroe Doctrine between the Western Hemisphere and
13084	Europe.
13085	
13086	Still America was a part of European civilization. Currents of opinion
13087	flowed to and fro across the Atlantic. Friends of popular government in
13088	Europe looked to America as the great exemplar of their ideals. Events
13089	in Europe reacted upon thought in the United States. The French
13090	Revolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political
13091	debate. While it was in the stage of mere reform all Americans favored
13092	it. When the king was executed and a radical democracy set up, American
13093	opinion was divided. When France fell under the military dominion of
13094	Napoleon and preyed upon American commerce, the United States made ready
13095	for war.
13096	
13097	The conduct of England likewise affected American affairs. In 1793 war
13098	broke out between England and France and raged with only a slight
13099	intermission until 1815. England and France both ravaged American
13100	commerce, but England was the more serious offender because she had
13101	command of the seas. Though Jefferson and Madison strove for peace, the
13102	country was swept into war by the vehemence of the "Young Republicans,"
13103	headed by Clay and Calhoun.
13104	
13105	When the armed conflict was closed, one in diplomacy opened. The
13106	autocratic powers of Europe threatened to intervene on behalf of Spain
13107	in her attempt to recover possession of her Latin-American colonies.
13108	Their challenge to America brought forth the Monroe Doctrine. The powers
13109	of Europe were warned not to interfere with the independence or the
13110	republican policies of this hemisphere or to attempt any new
13111	colonization in it. It seemed that nationalism was to have a peaceful
13112	triumph over sectionalism.

13206	CHAPTER X
13207	
13208	THE FARMERS BEYOND THE APPALACHIANS
13209	
13210	
13211	The nationalism of Hamilton was undemocratic. The democracy of Jefferson
13212	was, in the beginning, provincial. The historic mission of uniting
13213	nationalism and democracy was in the course of time given to new leaders
13214	from a region beyond the mountains, peopled by men and women from all
13215	sections and free from those state traditions which ran back to the
13216	early days of colonization. The voice of the democratic nationalism
13217	nourished in the West was heard when Clay of Kentucky advocated his
13218	American system of protection for industries; when Jackson of Tennessee
13219	condemned nullification in a ringing proclamation that has taken its
13220	place among the great American state papers; and when Lincoln of
13221	Illinois, in a fateful hour, called upon a bewildered people to meet the
13222	supreme test whether this was a nation destined to survive or to perish.
13223	And it will be remembered that Lincoln's party chose for its banner that
13224	earlier device--Republican--which Jefferson had made a sign of power.
13225	The "rail splitter" from Illinois united the nationalism of Hamilton
13226	with the democracy of Jefferson, and his appeal was clothed in the
13227	simple language of the people, not in the sonorous rhetoric which
13228	Webster learned in the schools.
13229	
13230	
13231	PREPARATION FOR WESTERN SETTLEMENT
13232	
13233	=The West and the American Revolution.=--The excessive attention devoted
13234	by historians to the military operations along the coast has obscured
13235	the role played by the frontier in the American Revolution. The action
13236	of Great Britain in closing western land to easy settlement in 1763 was
13237	more than an incident in precipitating the war for independence.
13238	Americans on the frontier did not forget it; when Indians were employed
13239	by England to defend that land, zeal for the patriot cause set the
13240	interior aflame. It was the members of the western vanguard, like Daniel
13241	Boone, John Sevier, and George Rogers Clark, who first understood the
13242	value of the far-away country under the guns of the English forts, where
13243	the Red Men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife. It was
13244	they who gave the East no rest until their vision was seen by the
13245	leaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy. It
13246	was one of their number, a seasoned Indian fighter, George Rogers Clark,
13247	who with aid from Virginia seized Kaskaskia and Vincennes and secured
13248	the whole Northwest to the union while the fate of Washington's army was
13249	still hanging in the balance.
13250	
13251	=Western Problems at the End of the Revolution.=--The treaty of peace,
13252	signed with Great Britain in 1783, brought the definite cession of the
13253	coveted territory west to the Mississippi River, but it left unsolved
13254	many problems. In the first place, tribes of resentful Indians in the
13255	Ohio region, even though British support was withdrawn at last, had to
13256	be reckoned with; and it was not until after the establishment of the
13257	federal Constitution that a well-equipped army could be provided to
13258	guarantee peace on the border. In the second place, British garrisons
13259	still occupied forts on Lake Erie pending the execution of the terms of
13260	the treaty of 1783--terms which were not fulfilled until after the
13261	ratification of the Jay treaty twelve years later. In the third place,
13262	Virginia, Connecticut, and Massachusetts had conflicting claims to the
13263	land in the Northwest based on old English charters and Indian treaties.
13264	It was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement
13265	to transfer their rights to the government of the United States,
13266	Virginia executing her deed of cession on March 1, 1784. In the fourth
13267	place, titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the
13268	absence of official maps and records. To meet this last situation,
13269	Congress instituted a systematic survey of the Ohio country, laying it
13270	out into townships, sections of 640 acres each, and quarter sections. In
13271	every township one section of land was set aside for the support of
13272	public schools.
13273	
13274	=The Northwest Ordinance.=--The final problem which had to be solved
13275	before settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing
13276	the territory. Pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile
13277	valley of the Ohio could hardly restrain their impatience. Soldiers of
13278	the Revolution, who had been paid for their services in land warrants
13279	entitling them to make entries in the West, called for action.
13280	
13281	Congress answered by passing in 1787 the famous Northwest Ordinance
13282	providing for temporary territorial government to be followed by the
13283	creation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free
13284	males in any district. Eventual admission to the union on an equal
13285	footing with the original states was promised to the new territories.
13286	Religious freedom was guaranteed. The safeguards of trial by jury,
13287	regular judicial procedure, and _habeas corpus_ were established, in order
13288	that the methods of civilized life might take the place of the
13289	rough-and-ready justice of lynch law. During the course of the debate on
13290	the Ordinance, Congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and
13291	involuntary servitude.
13292	
13293	This Charter of the Northwest, so well planned by the Congress under the
13294	Articles of Confederation, was continued in force by the first Congress
13295	under the Constitution in 1789. The following year its essential
13296	provisions, except the ban on slavery, were applied to the territory
13297	south of the Ohio, ceded by North Carolina to the national government,
13298	and in 1798 to the Mississippi territory, once held by Georgia. Thus it
13299	was settled for all time that "the new colonies were not to be exploited
13300	for the benefit of the parent states (any more than for the benefit of
13301	England) but were to be autonomous and coordinate commonwealths." This
13302	outcome, bitterly opposed by some Eastern leaders who feared the triumph
13303	of Western states over the seaboard, completed the legal steps necessary
13304	by way of preparation for the flood of settlers.
13305	
13306	=The Land Companies, Speculators, and Western Land Tenure.=--As in the
13307	original settlement of America, so in the opening of the West, great
13308	companies and single proprietors of large grants early figured. In 1787
13309	the Ohio Land Company, a New England concern, acquired a million and a
13310	half acres on the Ohio and began operations by planting the town of
13311	Marietta. A professional land speculator, J.C. Symmes, secured a million
13312	acres lower down where the city of Cincinnati was founded. Other
13313	individuals bought up soldiers' claims and so acquired enormous holdings
13314	for speculative purposes. Indeed, there was such a rush to make fortunes
13315	quickly through the rise in land values that Washington was moved to cry
13316	out against the "rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the
13317	North West of the Ohio," protesting that "scarce a valuable spot within
13318	any tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant." He therefore
13319	urged Congress to fix a reasonable price for the land, not "too
13320	exorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers, but high enough to
13321	discourage monopolizers."
13322	
13323	Congress, however, was not prepared to use the public domain for the
13324	sole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the West. It
13325	still looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of
13326	revenue with which to pay off the public debt; consequently it thought
13327	more of instant income than of ultimate results. It placed no limit on
13328	the amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at $2 an acre
13329	in 1796, and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the
13330	first installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small
13331	registration and survey fee. On such terms a speculator with a few
13332	thousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land. If he
13333	was fortunate in disposing of it, he could meet the installments, which
13334	were spread over a period of four years, and make a handsome profit for
13335	himself. Even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in
13336	1821 and the price of the land lowered to a cash price of $1.75 an acre,
13337	the opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract
13338	capital to land ventures.
13339	
13340	=The Development of the Small Freehold.=--The cheapness of land and the
13341	scarcity of labor, nevertheless, made impossible the triumph of the huge
13342	estate with its semi-servile tenantry. For about $45 a man could get a
13343	farm of 160 acres on the installment plan; another payment of $80 was
13344	due in forty days; but a four-year term was allowed for the discharge of
13345	the balance. With a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a
13346	family could embark on a land venture. If it had good crops, it could
13347	meet the deferred payments. It was, however, a hard battle at best. Many
13348	a man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment;
13349	yet in the end, in spite of all the handicaps, the small freehold of a
13350	few hundred acres at most became the typical unit of Western
13351	agriculture, except in the planting states of the Gulf. Even the lands
13352	of the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots.
13353	
13354	The tendency toward moderate holdings, so favored by Western conditions,
13355	was also promoted by a clause in the Northwest Ordinance declaring that
13356	the land of any person dying intestate--that is, without any will
13357	disposing of it--should be divided equally among his descendants.
13358	Hildreth says of this provision: "It established the important
13359	republican principle, not then introduced into all the states, of the
13360	equal distribution of landed as well as personal property." All these
13361	forces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth, in the early days of
13362	the nineteenth century, an American characteristic, in marked contrast
13363	with the European system of family prestige and vast estates based on
13364	the law of primogeniture.
13365	
13366	
13367	THE WESTERN MIGRATION AND NEW STATES
13368	
13369	=The People.=--With government established, federal arms victorious over
13370	the Indians, and the lands surveyed for sale, the way was prepared for
13371	the immigrants. They came with a rush. Young New Englanders, weary of
13372	tilling the stony soil of their native states, poured through New York
13373	and Pennsylvania, some settling on the northern bank of the Ohio but
13374	most of them in the Lake region. Sons and daughters of German farmers in
13375	Pennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of
13376	servitude pressed out into Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, or beyond. From
13377	the exhausted fields and the clay hills of the Southern states came
13378	pioneers of English and Scotch-Irish descent, the latter in great
13379	numbers. Indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that
13380	"the rapid expansion of the United States from a coast strip to a
13381	continental area is largely a Scotch-Irish achievement." While native
13382	Americans of mixed stocks led the way into the West, it was not long
13383	before immigrants direct from Europe, under the stimulus of company
13384	enterprise, began to filter into the new settlements in increasing
13385	numbers.
13386	
13387	The types of people were as various as the nations they represented.
13388	Timothy Flint, who published his entertaining _Recollections_ in 1826,
13389	found the West a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people.
13390	Some of them, he relates, had been hunters in the upper world of the
13391	Mississippi, above the falls of St. Anthony. Some had been still farther
13392	north, in Canada. Still others had wandered from the South--the Gulf of
13393	Mexico, the Red River, and the Spanish country. French boatmen and
13394	trappers, Spanish traders from the Southwest, Virginia planters with
13395	their droves of slaves mingled with English, German, and Scotch-Irish
13396	farmers. Hunters, forest rangers, restless bordermen, and squatters,
13397	like the foaming combers of an advancing tide, went first. Then followed
13398	the farmers, masters of the ax and plow, with their wives who shared
13399	every burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of
13400	civilized life. The hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes; the
13401	home makers built for all time.
13402	
13403	=The Number of Immigrants.=--There were no official stations on the
13404	frontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the West during
13405	the decades following the American Revolution. But travelers of the time
13406	record that every road was "crowded" with pioneers and their families,
13407	their wagons and cattle; and that they were seldom out of the sound of
13408	the snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack
13409	of the hunter's rifle as he brought down his evening meal. "During the
13410	latter half of 1787," says Coman, "more than nine hundred boats floated
13411	down the Ohio carrying eighteen thousand men, women, and children, and
13412	twelve thousand horses, sheep, and cattle, and six hundred and fifty
13413	wagons." Other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing
13414	years the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher.
13415	
13416	=The Western Routes.=--Four main routes led into the country beyond the
13417	Appalachians. The Genesee road, beginning at Albany, ran almost due west
13418	to the present site of Buffalo on Lake Erie, through a level country. In
13419	the dry season, wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into
13420	northern Ohio. A second route, through Pittsburgh, was fed by three
13421	eastern branches, one starting at Philadelphia, one at Baltimore, and
13422	another at Alexandria. A third main route wound through the mountains
13423	from Alexandria to Boonesboro in Kentucky and then westward across the
13424	Ohio to St. Louis. A fourth, the most famous of them all, passed through
13425	the Cumberland Gap and by branches extended into the Cumberland valley
13426	and the Kentucky country.
13427	
13428	Of these four lines of travel, the Pittsburgh route offered the most
13429	advantages. Pioneers, no matter from what section they came, when once
13430	they were on the headwaters of the Ohio and in possession of a flatboat,
13431	could find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the West and
13432	Southwest. Whether they wanted to settle in Ohio, Kentucky, or western
13433	Tennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their
13434	destination or at least to some spot near it. Many people from the South
13435	as well as the Northern and Middle states chose this route; so it came
13436	about that the sons and daughters of Virginia and the Carolinas mingled
13437	with those of New York, Pennsylvania, and New England in the settlement
13438	of the Northwest territory.
13439	
13440	=The Methods of Travel into the West.=--Many stories giving exact
13441	descriptions of methods of travel into the West in the early days have
13442	been preserved. The country was hardly opened before visitors from the
13443	Old World and from the Eastern states, impelled by curiosity, made their
13444	way to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or
13445	amuse the public. One of them, Gilbert Imlay, an English traveler, has
13446	given us an account of the Pittsburgh route as he found it in 1791. "If
13447	a man ... " he writes, "has a family or goods of any sort to remove, his
13448	best way, then, would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to
13449	carry his property to Redstone Old Fort or to Pittsburgh, according as
13450	he may come from the Northern or Southern states. A good waggon will
13451	cost, at Philadelphia, about $10 ... and the horses about $12 each; they
13452	would cost something more both at Baltimore and Alexandria. The waggon
13453	may be covered with canvass, and if it is the choice of the people, they
13454	may sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety. But if they dislike
13455	that, there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the
13456	different roads.... The provisions I would purchase in the same manner
13457	[that is, from the farmers along the road]; and by having two or three
13458	camp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon
13459	the brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress
13460	their own food.... This manner of journeying is so far from being
13461	disagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant." The
13462	immigrant once at Pittsburgh or Wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a
13463	size required for his goods and stock, and drift down the current to his
13464	journey's end.
13465	
13466	[Illustration: ROADS AND TRAILS INTO THE WESTERN TERRITORY]
13467	
13468	=The Admission of Kentucky and Tennessee.=--When the eighteenth century
13469	drew to a close, Kentucky had a population larger than Delaware, Rhode
13470	Island, or New Hampshire. Tennessee claimed 60,000 inhabitants. In 1792
13471	Kentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent,
13472	Virginia. The Eastern Federalists resented her intrusion; but they took
13473	some consolation in the admission of Vermont because the balance of
13474	Eastern power was still retained.
13475	
13476	As if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas
13477	the makers of Kentucky's first constitution swept aside the landed
13478	qualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males.
13479	Four years later, Kentucky's neighbor to the south, Tennessee, followed
13480	this step toward a wider democracy. After encountering fierce opposition
13481	from the Federalists, Tennessee was accepted as the sixteenth state.
13482	
13483	=Ohio.=--The door of the union had hardly opened for Tennessee when
13484	another appeal was made to Congress, this time from the pioneers in
13485	Ohio. The little posts founded at Marietta and Cincinnati had grown into
13486	flourishing centers of trade. The stream of immigrants, flowing down the
13487	river, added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all
13488	around poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for "store
13489	goods." After the Indians were disposed of in 1794 and the last British
13490	soldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the Jay treaty of
13491	1795, tiny settlements of families appeared on Lake Erie in the "Western
13492	Reserve," a region that had been retained by Connecticut when she
13493	surrendered her other rights in the Northwest.
13494	
13495	At the close of the century, Ohio, claiming a population of more than
13496	50,000, grew discontented with its territorial status. Indeed, two years
13497	before the enactment of the Northwest Ordinance, squatters in that
13498	region had been invited by one John Emerson to hold a convention after
13499	the fashion of the men of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield in old
13500	Connecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves. This true
13501	son of New England declared that men "have an undoubted right to pass
13502	into every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that
13503	from the confederation of the whole United States Congress is not
13504	empowered to forbid them." This grand convention was never held because
13505	the heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders; but the spirit
13506	of John Emerson did not perish. In November, 1802, a convention chosen
13507	by voters, assembled under the authority of Congress at Chillicothe,
13508	drew up a constitution. It went into force after a popular ratification.
13509	The roll of the convention bore such names as Abbot, Baldwin, Cutler,
13510	Huntington, Putnam, and Sargent, and the list of counties from which
13511	they came included Adams, Fairfield, Hamilton, Jefferson, Trumbull, and
13512	Washington, showing that the new America in the West was peopled and led
13513	by the old stock. In 1803 Ohio was admitted to the union.
13514	
13515	=Indiana and Illinois.=--As in the neighboring state, the frontier in
13516	Indiana advanced northward from the Ohio, mainly under the leadership,
13517	however, of settlers from the South--restless Kentuckians hoping for
13518	better luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of
13519	Virginia and North Carolina. As soon as a tier of counties swinging
13520	upward like the horns of the moon against Ohio on the east and in the
13521	Wabash Valley on the west was fairly settled, a clamor went up for
13522	statehood. Under the authority of an act of Congress in 1816 the
13523	Indianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at
13524	Corydon. "The majority of the members of the convention," we are told by
13525	a local historian, "were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what
13526	they wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues
13527	put it into shape."
13528	
13529	Two years later, the pioneers of Illinois, also settled upward from the
13530	Ohio, like Indiana, elected their delegates to draft a constitution.
13531	Leadership in the convention, quite properly, was taken by a man born in
13532	New York and reared in Tennessee; and the constitution as finally
13533	drafted "was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing
13534	constitutions of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.... Many of the articles
13535	are exact copies in wording although differently arranged and
13536	numbered."
13537	
13538	=Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.=--Across the Mississippi to the
13539	far south, clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and
13540	enterprise. The cotton and sugar lands of Louisiana, opened by French
13541	and Spanish settlers, were widened in every direction by planters with
13542	their armies of slaves from the older states. New Orleans, a good market
13543	and a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer, grew apace. In
13544	1810 the population of lower Louisiana was over 75,000. The time had
13545	come, said the leaders of the people, to fulfill the promise made to
13546	France in the treaty of cession; namely, to grant to the inhabitants of
13547	the territory statehood and the rights of American citizens. Federalists
13548	from New England still having a voice in Congress, if somewhat weaker,
13549	still protested in tones of horror. "I am compelled to declare it as my
13550	deliberate opinion," pronounced Josiah Quincy in the House of
13551	Representatives, "that if this bill [to admit Louisiana] passes, the
13552	bonds of this Union are virtually dissolved ... that as it will be the
13553	right of all, so it will be the duty of some [states] to prepare
13554	definitely for a separation; amicably if they can, violently if they
13555	must.... It is a death blow to the Constitution. It may afterwards
13556	linger; but lingering, its fate will, at no very distant period, be
13557	consummated." Federalists from New York like those from New England had
13558	their doubts about the wisdom of admitting Western states; but the party
13559	of Jefferson and Madison, having the necessary majority, granted the
13560	coveted statehood to Louisiana in 1812.
13561	
13562	When, a few years later, Mississippi and Alabama knocked at the doors of
13563	the union, the Federalists had so little influence, on account of their
13564	conduct during the second war with England, that spokesmen from the
13565	Southwest met a kindlier reception at Washington. Mississippi, in 1817,
13566	and Alabama, in 1819, took their places among the United States of
13567	America. Both of them, while granting white manhood suffrage, gave their
13568	constitutions the tone of the old East by providing landed
13569	qualifications for the governor and members of the legislature.
13570	
13571	=Missouri.=--Far to the north in the Louisiana purchase, a new
13572	commonwealth was rising to power. It was peopled by immigrants who came
13573	down the Ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the Mississippi from
13574	Kentucky and Tennessee. Thrifty Germans from Pennsylvania, hardy farmers
13575	from Virginia ready to work with their own hands, freemen seeking
13576	freemen's homes, planters with their slaves moving on from worn-out
13577	fields on the seaboard, came together in the widening settlements of the
13578	Missouri country. Peoples from the North and South flowed together,
13579	small farmers and big planters mingling in one community. When their
13580	numbers had reached sixty thousand or more, they precipitated a contest
13581	over their admission to the union, "ringing an alarm bell in the night,"
13582	as Jefferson phrased it. The favorite expedient of compromise with
13583	slavery was brought forth in Congress once more. Maine consequently was
13584	brought into the union without slavery and Missouri with slavery. At the
13585	same time there was drawn westward through the rest of the Louisiana
13586	territory a line separating servitude from slavery.
13587	
13588	
13589	THE SPIRIT OF THE FRONTIER
13590	
13591	=Land Tenure and Liberty.=--Over an immense western area there developed
13592	an unbroken system of freehold farms. In the Gulf states and the lower
13593	Mississippi Valley, it is true, the planter with his many slaves even
13594	led in the pioneer movement; but through large sections of Tennessee and
13595	Kentucky, as well as upper Georgia and Alabama, and all throughout the
13596	Northwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme. In this immense
13597	dominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or class--a body
13598	of people all having about the same amount of this world's goods and
13599	deriving their livelihood from one source: the labor of their own hands
13600	on the soil. The Northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all
13601	the original thirteen states combined, except Georgia, and its system of
13602	agricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates. "In
13603	the subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition," as
13604	Webster said on more than one occasion, "lay the true basis, most
13605	certainly, of popular government." There was the undoubted source of
13606	Jacksonian democracy.
13607	
13608	[Illustration: A LOG CABIN--LINCOLN'S BIRTHPLACE]
13609	
13610	=The Characteristics of the Western People.=--Travelers into the
13611	Northwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed
13612	that the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the
13613	characteristics common to an independent yeomanry. A close observer thus
13614	recorded his impressions: "A spirit of adventurous enterprise, a
13615	willingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object....
13616	Independence of thought and action. They have felt the influence of
13617	these principles from their childhood. Men who can endure anything; that
13618	have lived almost without restraint, free as the mountain air or as the
13619	deer and the buffalo of their forests, and who know they are Americans
13620	all.... An apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of
13621	manner.... Where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people
13622	who know little about each other's previous history or ancestry but
13623	where each is lord of the soil he cultivates. Where a log cabin is all
13624	that the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can
13625	possess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in
13626	creating a diversity of rank in society. These circumstances have laid
13627	the foundation for that equality of intercourse, simplicity of manners,
13628	want of deference, want of reserve, great readiness to make
13629	acquaintances, freedom of speech, indisposition to brook real or
13630	imaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the West."
13631	
13632	This equality, this independence, this rudeness so often described by
13633	the traveler as marking a new country, were all accentuated by the
13634	character of the settlers themselves. Traces of the fierce, unsociable,
13635	eagle-eyed, hard-drinking hunter remained. The settlers who followed the
13636	hunter were, with some exceptions, soldiers of the Revolutionary army,
13637	farmers of the "middling order," and mechanics from the towns,--English,
13638	Scotch-Irish, Germans,--poor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of
13639	their own hands for support. Sons and daughters from well-to-do Eastern
13640	homes sometimes brought softer manners; but the equality of life and the
13641	leveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit
13642	with their struggling neighbors. Even the preachers and teachers, who
13643	came when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and
13644	schoolhouses were built, preached sermons and taught lessons that
13645	savored of the frontier, as any one may know who reads Peter
13646	Cartwright's _A Muscular Christian_ or Eggleston's _The Hoosier
13647	Schoolmaster_.
13648	
13649	
13650	THE WEST AND THE EAST MEET
13651	
13652	=The East Alarmed.=--A people so independent as the Westerners and so
13653	attached to local self-government gave the conservative East many a rude
13654	shock, setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with
13655	the idea that terrible things might happen in the Mississippi Valley.
13656	Not without good grounds did Washington fear that "a touch of a feather
13657	would turn" the Western settlers away from the seaboard to the
13658	Spaniards; and seriously did he urge the East not to neglect them, lest
13659	they be "drawn into the arms of, or be dependent upon foreigners."
13660	Taking advantage of the restless spirit in the Southwest, Aaron Burr,
13661	having disgraced himself by killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel, laid
13662	wild plans, if not to bring about a secession in that region, at least
13663	to build a state of some kind out of the Spanish dominions adjoining
13664	Louisiana. Frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of
13665	the West, the Federalists, with a few conspicuous exceptions, opposed
13666	equality between the sections. Had their narrow views prevailed, the
13667	West, with its new democracy, would have been held in perpetual tutelage
13668	to the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen
13669	colonies had been not long before.
13670	
13671	=Eastern Friends of the West.=--Fortunately for the nation, there were
13672	many Eastern leaders, particularly from the South, who understood the
13673	West, approved its spirit, and sought to bring the two sections together
13674	by common bonds. Washington kept alive and keen the zeal for Western
13675	advancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor. He never grew
13676	tired of urging upon his Eastern friends the importance of the lands
13677	beyond the mountains. He pressed upon the governor of Virginia a project
13678	for a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the Ohio country and was
13679	active in a movement to improve the navigation of the Potomac. He
13680	advocated strengthening the ties of commerce. "Smooth the roads," he
13681	said, "and make easy the way for them, and then see what an influx of
13682	articles will be poured upon us; how amazingly our exports will be
13683	increased by them; and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble
13684	and expense we may encounter to effect it." Jefferson, too, was
13685	interested in every phase of Western development--the survey of lands,
13686	the exploration of waterways, the opening of trade, and even the
13687	discovery of the bones of prehistoric animals. Robert Fulton, the
13688	inventor of the steamboat, was another man of vision who for many years
13689	pressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting East and West by a
13690	canal which would cement the union, raise the value of the public lands,
13691	and extend the principles of confederate and republican government.
13692	
13693	=The Difficulties of Early Transportation.=--Means of communication
13694	played an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to
13695	bring together the seaboard and the frontier. The produce of the
13696	West--wheat, corn, bacon, hemp, cattle, and tobacco--was bulky and the
13697	cost of overland transportation was prohibitive. In the Eastern market,
13698	"a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt, while a suit of
13699	'store clothes' cost as much as a farm." In such circumstances, the
13700	inhabitants of the Mississippi Valley were forced to ship their produce
13701	over a long route by way of New Orleans and to pay high freight rates
13702	for everything that was brought across the mountains. Scows of from five
13703	to fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down
13704	the stream to the Crescent City. In a few cases small ocean-going
13705	vessels were built to transport goods to the West Indies or to the
13706	Eastern coast towns. Salt, iron, guns, powder, and the absolute
13707	essentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in Eastern markets were
13708	carried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the
13709	rainy season.
13710	
13711	=The National Road.=--To far-sighted men, like Albert Gallatin, "the
13712	father of internal improvements," the solution of this problem was the
13713	construction of roads and canals. Early in Jefferson's administration,
13714	Congress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to
13715	building highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying
13716	into the Atlantic to the Ohio River and beyond into the Northwest
13717	territory. In 1806, after many misgivings, it authorized a great
13718	national highway binding the East and the West. The Cumberland Road, as
13719	it was called, began in northwestern Maryland, wound through southern
13720	Pennsylvania, crossed the narrow neck of Virginia at Wheeling, and then
13721	shot almost straight across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, into Missouri.
13722	By 1817, stagecoaches were running between Washington and Wheeling; by
13723	1833 contractors had carried their work to Columbus, Ohio, and by 1852,
13724	to Vandalia, Illinois. Over this ballasted road mail and passenger
13725	coaches could go at high speed, and heavy freight wagons proceed in
13726	safety at a steady pace.
13727	
13728	[Illustration: THE CUMBERLAND ROAD]
13729	
13730	=Canals and Steamboats.=--A second epoch in the economic union of the
13731	East and West was reached with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825,
13732	offering an all-water route from New York City to the Great Lakes and
13733	the Mississippi Valley. Pennsylvania, alarmed by the advantages
13734	conferred on New York by this enterprise, began her system of canals and
13735	portages from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, completing the last link in
13736	1834. In the South, the Chesapeake and Ohio Company, chartered in 1825,
13737	was busy with a project to connect Georgetown and Cumberland when
13738	railways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished.
13739	About the same time, Ohio built a canal across the state, affording
13740	water communication between Lake Erie and the Ohio River through a rich
13741	wheat belt. Passengers could now travel by canal boat into the West with
13742	comparative ease and comfort, if not at a rapid speed, and the bulkiest
13743	of freight could be easily handled. Moreover, the rate charged for
13744	carrying goods was cut by the Erie Canal from $32 a ton per hundred
13745	miles to $1. New Orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the
13746	Mississippi Valley.
13747	
13748	The diversion of traffic to Eastern markets was also stimulated by
13749	steamboats which appeared on the Ohio about 1810, three years after
13750	Fulton had made his famous trip on the Hudson. It took twenty men to
13751	sail and row a five-ton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to
13752	twenty miles a day. In 1825, Timothy Flint traveled a hundred miles a
13753	day on the new steamer _Grecian_ "against the whole weight of the
13754	Mississippi current." Three years later the round trip from Louisville
13755	to New Orleans was cut to eight days. Heavy produce that once had to
13756	float down to New Orleans could be carried upstream and sent to the East
13757	by way of the canal systems.
13758	
13759	[Illustration: _From an old print_
13760	
13761	AN EARLY MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOAT]
13762	
13763	Thus the far country was brought near. The timid no longer hesitated at
13764	the thought of the perilous journey. All routes were crowded with
13765	Western immigrants. The forests fell before the ax like grain before the
13766	sickle. Clearings scattered through the woods spread out into a great
13767	mosaic of farms stretching from the Southern Appalachians to Lake
13768	Michigan. The national census of 1830 gave 937,000 inhabitants to Ohio;
13769	343,000 to Indiana; 157,000 to Illinois; 687,000 to Kentucky; and
13770	681,000 to Tennessee.
13771	
13772	[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1830]
13773	
13774	With the increase in population and the growth of agriculture came
13775	political influence. People who had once petitioned Congress now sent
13776	their own representatives. Men who had hitherto accepted without
13777	protests Presidents from the seaboard expressed a new spirit of dissent
13778	in 1824 by giving only three electoral votes for John Quincy Adams; and
13779	four years later they sent a son of the soil from Tennessee, Andrew
13780	Jackson, to take Washington's chair as chief executive of the
13781	nation--the first of a long line of Presidents from the Mississippi
13782	basin.

13859	CHAPTER XI
13860	
13861	JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY
13862	
13863	
13864	The New England Federalists, at the Hartford convention, prophesied that
13865	in time the West would dominate the East. "At the adoption of the
13866	Constitution," they said, "a certain balance of power among the original
13867	states was considered to exist, and there was at that time and yet is
13868	among those parties a strong affinity between their great and general
13869	interests. By the admission of these [new] states that balance has been
13870	materially affected and unless the practice be modified must ultimately
13871	be destroyed. The Southern states will first avail themselves of their
13872	new confederates to govern the East, and finally the Western states,
13873	multiplied in number, and augmented in population, will control the
13874	interests of the whole." Strangely enough the fulfillment of this
13875	prophecy was being prepared even in Federalist strongholds by the rise
13876	of a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers
13877	beyond the mountains.
13878	
13879	
13880	THE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IN THE EAST
13881	
13882	=The Aristocratic Features of the Old Order.=--The Revolutionary
13883	fathers, in setting up their first state constitutions, although they
13884	often spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed, did
13885	not think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males.
13886	On the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe
13887	"depositary" of political power. They went back to the colonial
13888	tradition that related taxation and representation. This, they argued,
13889	was not only just but a safeguard against the "excesses of democracy."
13890	
13891	In carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or
13892	property qualifications on the right to vote. Broadly speaking, these
13893	limitations fell into three classes. Three states, Pennsylvania (1776),
13894	New Hampshire (1784), and Georgia (1798), gave the ballot to all who
13895	paid taxes, without reference to the value of their property. Three,
13896	Virginia, Delaware, and Rhode Island, clung firmly to the ancient
13897	principles that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral
13898	rights. Still other states, while closely restricting the suffrage,
13899	accepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of
13900	the requirements. In Massachusetts, for instance, the vote was granted
13901	to all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or
13902	possessed other property worth sixty pounds.
13903	
13904	The electors thus enfranchised, numerous as they were, owing to the wide
13905	distribution of land, often suffered from a very onerous disability. In
13906	many states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because
13907	heavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers. In New
13908	Hampshire, the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds, one-half in
13909	land; in Massachusetts, one thousand pounds, all freehold; in Maryland,
13910	five thousand pounds, one thousand of which was freehold; in North
13911	Carolina, one thousand pounds freehold; and in South Carolina, ten
13912	thousand pounds freehold. A state senator in Massachusetts had to be the
13913	owner of a freehold worth three hundred pounds or personal property
13914	worth six hundred pounds; in New Jersey, one thousand pounds' worth of
13915	property; in North Carolina, three hundred acres of land; in South
13916	Carolina, two thousand pounds freehold. For members of the lower house
13917	of the legislature lower qualifications were required.
13918	
13919	In most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were
13920	further restricted by religious provisions. No single sect was powerful
13921	enough to dominate after the Revolution, but, for the most part,
13922	Catholics and Jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office.
13923	North Carolina and Georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a
13924	Protestant. Delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the
13925	Trinity and the inspiration of the Scriptures. Massachusetts and
13926	Maryland limited it to Christians. Virginia and New York, advanced for
13927	their day, made no discrimination in government on account of religious
13928	opinion.
13929	
13930	=The Defense of the Old Order.=--It must not be supposed that property
13931	qualifications were thoughtlessly imposed at the outset or considered of
13932	little consequence in practice. In the beginning they were viewed as
13933	fundamental. As towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens
13934	increased, the restrictions were defended with even more vigor. In
13935	Massachusetts, the great Webster upheld the rights of property in
13936	government, saying: "It is entirely just that property should have its
13937	due weight and consideration in political arrangements.... The
13938	disastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed, those political
13939	thunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society
13940	to their deepest foundations, have been revolutions against property."
13941	In Pennsylvania, a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to
13942	remove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage: "What does the delegate
13943	propose? To place the vicious vagrant, the wandering Arabs, the Tartar
13944	hordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man?"
13945	In Virginia, Jefferson himself had first believed in property
13946	qualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the "mobs of the great
13947	cities." It was near the end of the eighteenth century before he
13948	accepted the idea of manhood suffrage. Even then he was unable to
13949	convince the constitution-makers of his own state. "It is not an idle
13950	chimera of the brain," urged one of them, "that the possession of land
13951	furnishes the strongest evidence of permanent, common interest with, and
13952	attachment to, the community.... It is upon this foundation I wish to
13953	place the right of suffrage. This is the best general standard which can
13954	be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be
13955	invested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be,
13956	consistently with the safety and well-being of the community, intrusted
13957	with the exercise of that right."
13958	
13959	=Attacks on the Restricted Suffrage.=--The changing circumstances of
13960	American life, however, soon challenged the rule of those with property.
13961	Prominent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business
13962	interests. Where the freehold qualification was applied, business men
13963	who did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office.
13964	In New York, for example, the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred
13965	pounds' worth of land could vote for state senator and governor, while
13966	the landless banker or merchant could not. It is not surprising,
13967	therefore, to find business men taking the lead in breaking down
13968	freehold limitations on the suffrage. The professional classes also were
13969	interested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from
13970	public affairs. It was a schoolmaster, Thomas Dorr, who led the popular
13971	uprising in Rhode Island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders
13972	to an end.
13973	
13974	In addition to the business and professional classes, the mechanics of
13975	the towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that
13976	generally barred them from voting or holding office. Though not
13977	numerous, they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of
13978	public affairs. They had led the riots against the Stamp Act, overturned
13979	King George's statue, and "crammed stamps down the throats of
13980	collectors." When the state constitutions were framed they took a lively
13981	interest, particularly in New York City and Philadelphia. In June, 1776,
13982	the "mechanicks in union" in New York protested against putting the new
13983	state constitution into effect without their approval, declaring that
13984	the right to vote on the acceptance or rejection of a fundamental law
13985	"is the birthright of every man to whatever state he may belong." Though
13986	their petition was rejected, their spirit remained. When, a few years
13987	later, the federal Constitution was being framed, the mechanics watched
13988	the process with deep concern; they knew that one of its main objects
13989	was to promote trade and commerce, affecting directly their daily bread.
13990	During the struggle over ratification, they passed resolutions approving
13991	its provisions and they often joined in parades organized to stir up
13992	sentiment for the Constitution, even though they could not vote for
13993	members of the state conventions and so express their will directly.
13994	After the organization of trade unions they collided with the courts of
13995	law and thus became interested in the election of judges and lawmakers.
13996	
13997	Those who attacked the old system of class rule found a strong moral
13998	support in the Declaration of Independence. Was it not said that all men
13999	are created equal? Whoever runs may read. Was it not declared that
14000	governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed?
14001	That doctrine was applied with effect to George III and seemed
14002	appropriate for use against the privileged classes of Massachusetts or
14003	Virginia. "How do the principles thus proclaimed," asked the
14004	non-freeholders of Richmond, in petitioning for the ballot, "accord with
14005	the existing regulation of the suffrage? A regulation which, instead of
14006	the equality nature ordains, creates an odious distinction between
14007	members of the same community ... and vests in a favored class, not in
14008	consideration of their public services but of their private possessions,
14009	the highest of all privileges."
14010	
14011	=Abolition of Property Qualifications.=--By many minor victories rather
14012	than by any spectacular triumphs did the advocates of manhood suffrage
14013	carry the day. Slight gains were made even during the Revolution or
14014	shortly afterward. In Pennsylvania, the mechanics, by taking an active
14015	part in the contest over the Constitution of 1776, were able to force
14016	the qualification down to the payment of a small tax. Vermont came into
14017	the union in 1792 without any property restrictions. In the same year
14018	Delaware gave the vote to all men who paid taxes. Maryland, reckoned one
14019	of the most conservative of states, embarked on the experiment of
14020	manhood suffrage in 1809; and nine years later, Connecticut, equally
14021	conservative, decided that all taxpayers were worthy of the ballot.
14022	
14023	Five states, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Rhode Island, and North
14024	Carolina, remained obdurate while these changes were going on around
14025	them; finally they had to yield themselves. The last struggle in
14026	Massachusetts took place in the constitutional convention of 1820. There
14027	Webster, in the prime of his manhood, and John Adams, in the closing
14028	years of his old age, alike protested against such radical innovations
14029	as manhood suffrage. Their protests were futile. The property test was
14030	abolished and a small tax-paying qualification was substituted. New York
14031	surrendered the next year and, after trying some minor restrictions for
14032	five years, went completely over to white manhood suffrage in 1826.
14033	Rhode Island clung to her freehold qualification through thirty years of
14034	agitation. Then Dorr's Rebellion, almost culminating in bloodshed,
14035	brought about a reform in 1843 which introduced a slight tax-paying
14036	qualification as an alternative to the freehold. Virginia and North
14037	Carolina were still unconvinced. The former refused to abandon ownership
14038	of land as the test for political rights until 1850 and the latter until
14039	1856. Although religious discriminations and property qualifications for
14040	office holders were sometimes retained after the establishment of
14041	manhood suffrage, they were usually abolished along with the monopoly of
14042	government enjoyed by property owners and taxpayers.
14043	
14044	[Illustration: THOMAS DORR AROUSING HIS FOLLOWERS]
14045	
14046	At the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the white
14047	male industrial workers and the mechanics of the Northern cities, at
14048	least, could lay aside the petition for the ballot and enjoy with the
14049	free farmer a voice in the government of their common country.
14050	"Universal democracy," sighed Carlyle, who was widely read in the United
14051	States, "whatever we may think of it has declared itself the inevitable
14052	fact of the days in which we live; and he who has any chance to instruct
14053	or lead in these days must begin by admitting that ... Where no
14054	government is wanted, save that of the parish constable, as in America
14055	with its boundless soil, every man being able to find work and
14056	recompense for himself, democracy may subsist; not elsewhere." Amid the
14057	grave misgivings of the first generation of statesmen, America was
14058	committed to the great adventure, in the populous towns of the East as
14059	well as in the forests and fields of the West.
14060	
14061	
14062	THE NEW DEMOCRACY ENTERS THE ARENA
14063	
14064	The spirit of the new order soon had a pronounced effect on the
14065	machinery of government and the practice of politics. The enfranchised
14066	electors were not long in demanding for themselves a larger share in
14067	administration.
14068	
14069	=The Spoils System and Rotation in Office.=--First of all they wanted
14070	office for themselves, regardless of their fitness. They therefore
14071	extended the system of rewarding party workers with government
14072	positions--a system early established in several states, notably New
14073	York and Pennsylvania. Closely connected with it was the practice of
14074	fixing short terms for officers and making frequent changes in
14075	personnel. "Long continuance in office," explained a champion of this
14076	idea in Pennsylvania in 1837, "unfits a man for the discharge of its
14077	duties, by rendering him arbitrary and aristocratic, and tends to beget,
14078	first life office, and then hereditary office, which leads to the
14079	destruction of free government." The solution offered was the historic
14080	doctrine of "rotation in office." At the same time the principle of
14081	popular election was extended to an increasing number of officials who
14082	had once been appointed either by the governor or the legislature. Even
14083	geologists, veterinarians, surveyors, and other technical officers were
14084	declared elective on the theory that their appointment "smacked of
14085	monarchy."
14086	
14087	=Popular Election of Presidential Electors.=--In a short time the spirit
14088	of democracy, while playing havoc with the old order in state
14089	government, made its way upward into the federal system. The framers of
14090	the Constitution, bewildered by many proposals and unable to agree on
14091	any single plan, had committed the choice of presidential electors to
14092	the discretion of the state legislatures. The legislatures, in turn,
14093	greedy of power, early adopted the practice of choosing the electors
14094	themselves; but they did not enjoy it long undisturbed. Democracy,
14095	thundering at their doors, demanded that they surrender the privilege to
14096	the people. Reluctantly they yielded, sometimes granting popular
14097	election and then withdrawing it. The drift was inevitable, and the
14098	climax came with the advent of Jacksonian democracy. In 1824, Vermont,
14099	New York, Delaware, South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, though some
14100	had experimented with popular election, still left the choice of
14101	electors with the legislature. Eight years later South Carolina alone
14102	held to the old practice. Popular election had become the final word.
14103	The fanciful idea of an electoral college of "good and wise men,"
14104	selected without passion or partisanship by state legislatures acting as
14105	deliberative bodies, was exploded for all time; the election of the
14106	nation's chief magistrate was committed to the tempestuous methods of
14107	democracy.
14108	
14109	=The Nominating Convention.=--As the suffrage was widened and the
14110	popular choice of presidential electors extended, there arose a violent
14111	protest against the methods used by the political parties in nominating
14112	candidates. After the retirement of Washington, both the Republicans and
14113	the Federalists found it necessary to agree upon their favorites before
14114	the election, and they adopted a colonial device--the pre-election
14115	caucus. The Federalist members of Congress held a conference and
14116	selected their candidate, and the Republicans followed the example. In
14117	a short time the practice of nominating by a "congressional caucus"
14118	became a recognized institution. The election still remained with the
14119	people; but the power of picking candidates for their approval passed
14120	into the hands of a small body of Senators and Representatives.
14121	
14122	
14123	A reaction against this was unavoidable. To friends of "the plain
14124	people," like Andrew Jackson, it was intolerable, all the more so
14125	because the caucus never favored him with the nomination. More
14126	conservative men also found grave objections to it. They pointed out
14127	that, whereas the Constitution intended the President to be an
14128	independent officer, he had now fallen under the control of a caucus of
14129	congressmen. The supremacy of the legislative branch had been obtained
14130	by an extra-legal political device. To such objections were added
14131	practical considerations. In 1824, when personal rivalry had taken the
14132	place of party conflicts, the congressional caucus selected as the
14133	candidate, William H. Crawford, of Georgia, a man of distinction but no
14134	great popularity, passing by such an obvious hero as General Jackson.
14135	The followers of the General were enraged and demanded nothing short of
14136	the death of "King Caucus." Their clamor was effective. Under their
14137	attacks, the caucus came to an ignominious end.
14138	
14139	In place of it there arose in 1831 a new device, the national nominating
14140	convention, composed of delegates elected by party voters for the sole
14141	purpose of nominating candidates. Senators and Representatives were
14142	still prominent in the party councils, but they were swamped by hundreds
14143	of delegates "fresh from the people," as Jackson was wont to say. In
14144	fact, each convention was made up mainly of office holders and office
14145	seekers, and the new institution was soon denounced as vigorously as
14146	King Caucus had been, particularly by statesmen who failed to obtain a
14147	nomination. Still it grew in strength and by 1840 was firmly
14148	established.
14149	
14150	=The End of the Old Generation.=--In the election of 1824, the
14151	representatives of the "aristocracy" made their last successful stand.
14152	Until then the leadership by men of "wealth and talents" had been
14153	undisputed. There had been five Presidents--Washington, John Adams,
14154	Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe--all Eastern men brought up in prosperous
14155	families with the advantages of culture which come from leisure and the
14156	possession of life's refinements. None of them had ever been compelled
14157	to work with his hands for a livelihood. Four of them had been
14158	slaveholders. Jefferson was a philosopher, learned in natural science, a
14159	master of foreign languages, a gentleman of dignity and grace of manner,
14160	notwithstanding his studied simplicity. Madison, it was said, was armed
14161	"with all the culture of his century." Monroe was a graduate of William
14162	and Mary, a gentleman of the old school. Jefferson and his three
14163	successors called themselves Republicans and professed a genuine faith
14164	in the people but they were not "of the people" themselves; they were
14165	not sons of the soil or the workshop. They were all men of "the grand
14166	
14167	old order of society" who gave finish and style even to popular
14168	government.
14169	
14170	Monroe was the last of the Presidents belonging to the heroic epoch of
14171	the Revolution. He had served in the war for independence, in the
14172	Congress under the Articles of Confederation, and in official capacity
14173	after the adoption of the Constitution. In short, he was of the age that
14174	had wrought American independence and set the government afloat. With
14175	his passing, leadership went to a new generation; but his successor,
14176	John Quincy Adams, formed a bridge between the old and the new in that
14177	he combined a high degree of culture with democratic sympathies.
14178	Washington had died in 1799, preceded but a few months by Patrick Henry
14179	and followed in four years by Samuel Adams. Hamilton had been killed in
14180	a duel with Burr in 1804. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were yet alive
14181	in 1824 but they were soon to pass from the scene, reconciled at last,
14182	full of years and honors. Madison was in dignified retirement, destined
14183	to live long enough to protest against the doctrine of nullification
14184	proclaimed by South Carolina before death carried him away at the ripe
14185	old age of eighty-five.
14186	
14187	=The Election of John Quincy Adams (1824).=--The campaign of 1824 marked
14188	the end of the "era of good feeling" inaugurated by the collapse of the
14189	Federalist party after the election of 1816. There were four leading
14190	candidates, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and W.H.
14191	Crawford. The result of the election was a division of the electoral
14192	votes into four parts and no one received a majority. Under the
14193	Constitution, therefore, the selection of President passed to the House
14194	of Representatives. Clay, who stood at the bottom of the poll, threw his
14195	weight to Adams and assured his triumph, much to the chagrin of
14196	Jackson's friends. They thought, with a certain justification, that
14197	inasmuch as the hero of New Orleans had received the largest electoral
14198	vote, the House was morally bound to accept the popular judgment and
14199	make him President. Jackson shook hands cordially with Adams on the day
14200	of the inauguration, but never forgave him for being elected.
14201	
14202	While Adams called himself a Republican in politics and often spoke of
14203	"the rule of the people," he was regarded by Jackson's followers as "an
14204	aristocrat." He was not a son of the soil. Neither was he acquainted at
14205	first hand with the labor of farmers and mechanics. He had been educated
14206	at Harvard and in Europe. Like his illustrious father, John Adams, he
14207	was a stern and reserved man, little given to seeking popularity.
14208	Moreover, he was from the East and the frontiersmen of the West regarded
14209	him as a man "born with a silver spoon in his mouth." Jackson's
14210	supporters especially disliked him because they thought their hero
14211	entitled to the presidency. Their anger was deepened when Adams
14212	appointed Clay to the office of Secretary of State; and they set up a
14213	cry that there had been a "deal" by which Clay had helped to elect Adams
14214	to get office for himself.
14215	
14216	Though Adams conducted his administration with great dignity and in a
14217	fine spirit of public service, he was unable to overcome the opposition
14218	which he encountered on his election to office or to win popularity in
14219	the West and South. On the contrary, by advocating government assistance
14220	in building roads and canals and public grants in aid of education,
14221	arts, and sciences, he ran counter to the current which had set in
14222	against appropriations of federal funds for internal improvements. By
14223	signing the Tariff Bill of 1828, soon known as the "Tariff of
14224	Abominations," he made new enemies without adding to his friends in New
14225	York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio where he sorely needed them. Handicapped by
14226	the false charge that he had been a party to a "corrupt bargain" with
14227	Clay to secure his first election; attacked for his advocacy of a high
14228	protective tariff; charged with favoring an "aristocracy of
14229	office-holders" in Washington on account of his refusal to discharge
14230	government clerks by the wholesale, Adams was retired from the White
14231	House after he had served four years.
14232	
14233	=The Triumph of Jackson in 1828.=--Probably no candidate for the
14234	presidency ever had such passionate popular support as Andrew Jackson
14235	had in 1828. He was truly a man of the people. Born of poor parents in
14236	the upland region of South Carolina, schooled in poverty and adversity,
14237	without the advantages of education or the refinements of cultivated
14238	leisure, he seemed the embodiment of the spirit of the new American
14239	democracy. Early in his youth he had gone into the frontier of Tennessee
14240	where he soon won a name as a fearless and intrepid Indian fighter. On
14241	the march and in camp, he endeared himself to his men by sharing their
14242	hardships, sleeping on the ground with them, and eating parched corn
14243	when nothing better could be found for the privates. From local
14244	prominence he sprang into national fame by his exploit at the battle of
14245	New Orleans. His reputation as a military hero was enhanced by the
14246	feeling that he had been a martyr to political treachery in 1824. The
14247	farmers of the West and South claimed him as their own. The mechanics of
14248	the Eastern cities, newly enfranchised, also looked upon him as their
14249	friend. Though his views on the tariff, internal improvements, and other
14250	issues before the country were either vague or unknown, he was readily
14251	elected President.
14252	
14253	The returns of the electoral vote in 1828 revealed the sources of
14254	Jackson's power. In New England, he received but one ballot, from
14255	Maine; he had a majority of the electors in New York and all of them in
14256	Pennsylvania; and he carried every state south of Maryland and beyond
14257	the Appalachians. Adams did not get a single electoral vote in the South
14258	and West. The prophecy of the Hartford convention had been fulfilled.
14259	
14260	[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON]
14261	
14262	When Jackson took the oath of office on March 4, 1829, the government of
14263	the United States entered into a new era. Until this time the
14264	inauguration of a President--even that of Jefferson, the apostle of
14265	simplicity--had brought no rude shock to the course of affairs at the
14266	capital. Hitherto the installation of a President meant that an
14267	old-fashioned gentleman, accompanied by a few servants, had driven to
14268	the White House in his own coach, taken the oath with quiet dignity,
14269	appointed a few new men to the higher posts, continued in office the
14270	long list of regular civil employees, and begun his administration with
14271	respectable decorum. Jackson changed all this. When he was inaugurated,
14272	men and women journeyed hundreds of miles to witness the ceremony. Great
14273	throngs pressed into the White House, "upset the bowls of punch, broke
14274	the glasses, and stood with their muddy boots on the satin-covered
14275	chairs to see the people's President." If Jefferson's inauguration was,
14276	as he called it, the "great revolution," Jackson's inauguration was a
14277	cataclysm.
14278	
14279	
14280	THE NEW DEMOCRACY AT WASHINGTON
14281	
14282	=The Spoils System.=--The staid and respectable society of Washington
14283	was disturbed by this influx of farmers and frontiersmen. To speak of
14284	politics became "bad form" among fashionable women. The clerks and
14285	civil servants of the government who had enjoyed long and secure tenure
14286	of office became alarmed at the clamor of new men for their positions.
14287	Doubtless the major portion of them had opposed the election of Jackson
14288	and looked with feelings akin to contempt upon him and his followers.
14289	With a hunter's instinct, Jackson scented his prey. Determined to have
14290	none but his friends in office, he made a clean sweep, expelling old
14291	employees to make room for men "fresh from the people." This was a new
14292	custom. Other Presidents had discharged a few officers for engaging in
14293	opposition politics. They had been careful in making appointments not to
14294	choose inveterate enemies; but they discharged relatively few men on
14295	account of their political views and partisan activities.
14296	
14297	By wholesale removals and the frank selection of officers on party
14298	grounds--a practice already well intrenched in New York--Jackson
14299	established the "spoils system" at Washington. The famous slogan, "to
14300	the victor belong the spoils of victory," became the avowed principle of
14301	the national government. Statesmen like Calhoun denounced it; poets like
14302	James Russell Lowell ridiculed it; faithful servants of the government
14303	suffered under it; but it held undisturbed sway for half a century
14304	thereafter, each succeeding generation outdoing, if possible, its
14305	predecessor in the use of public office for political purposes. If any
14306	one remarked that training and experience were necessary qualifications
14307	for important public positions, he met Jackson's own profession of
14308	faith: "The duties of any public office are so simple or admit of being
14309	made so simple that any man can in a short time become master of them."
14310	
14311	=The Tariff and Nullification.=--Jackson had not been installed in power
14312	very long before he was compelled to choose between states' rights and
14313	nationalism. The immediate occasion of the trouble was the tariff--a
14314	matter on which Jackson did not have any very decided views. His mind
14315	did not run naturally to abstruse economic questions; and owing to the
14316	divided opinion of the country it was "good politics" to be vague and
14317	ambiguous in the controversy. Especially was this true, because the
14318	tariff issue was threatening to split the country into parties again.
14319	
14320	_The Development of the Policy of "Protection."_--The war of 1812 and
14321	the commercial policies of England which followed it had accentuated the
14322	need for American economic independence. During that conflict, the
14323	United States, cut off from English manufactures as during the
14324	Revolution, built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron,
14325	steel, cloth, and other military and naval supplies as well as the
14326	demands from ordinary markets. Iron foundries and textile mills sprang
14327	up as in the night; hundreds of business men invested fortunes in
14328	industrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the
14329	government; and the people at large fell into the habit of buying
14330	American-made goods again. As the London _Times_ tersely observed of the
14331	Americans, "their first war with England made them independent; their
14332	second war made them formidable."
14333	
14334	In recognition of this state of affairs, the tariff of 1816 was
14335	designed: _first_, to prevent England from ruining these "infant
14336	industries" by dumping the accumulated stores of years suddenly upon
14337	American markets; and, _secondly_, to enlarge in the manufacturing
14338	centers the demand for American agricultural produce. It accomplished
14339	the purposes of its framers. It kept in operation the mills and furnaces
14340	so recently built. It multiplied the number of industrial workers and
14341	enhanced the demand for the produce of the soil. It brought about
14342	another very important result. It turned the capital and enterprise of
14343	New England from shipping to manufacturing, and converted her statesmen,
14344	once friends of low tariffs, into ardent advocates of protection.
14345	
14346	In the early years of the nineteenth century, the Yankees had bent their
14347	energies toward building and operating ships to carry produce from
14348	America to Europe and manufactures from Europe to America. For this
14349	reason, they had opposed the tariff of 1816 calculated to increase
14350	domestic production and cut down the carrying trade. Defeated in their
14351	efforts, they accepted the inevitable and turned to manufacturing. Soon
14352	they were powerful friends of protection for American enterprise. As the
14353	money invested and the labor employed in the favored industries
14354	increased, the demand for continued and heavier protection grew apace.
14355	Even the farmers who furnished raw materials, like wool, flax, and hemp,
14356	began to see eye to eye with the manufacturers. So the textile interests
14357	of New England, the iron masters of Connecticut, New Jersey, and
14358	Pennsylvania, the wool, hemp, and flax growers of Ohio, Kentucky, and
14359	Tennessee, and the sugar planters of Louisiana developed into a
14360	formidable combination in support of a high protective tariff.
14361	
14362	_The Planting States Oppose the Tariff._--In the meantime, the cotton
14363	states on the seaboard had forgotten about the havoc wrought during the
14364	Napoleonic wars when their produce rotted because there were no ships to
14365	carry it to Europe. The seas were now open. The area devoted to cotton
14366	had swiftly expanded as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana were opened
14367	up. Cotton had in fact become "king" and the planters depended for their
14368	prosperity, as they thought, upon the sale of their staple to English
14369	manufacturers whose spinning and weaving mills were the wonder of the
14370	world. Manufacturing nothing and having to buy nearly everything except
14371	farm produce and even much of that for slaves, the planters naturally
14372	wanted to purchase manufactures in the cheapest market, England, where
14373	they sold most of their cotton. The tariff, they contended, raised the
14374	price of the goods they had to buy and was thus in fact a tribute laid
14375	on them for the benefit of the Northern mill owners.
14376	
14377	_The Tariff of Abominations._--They were overborne, however, in 1824 and
14378	again in 1828 when Northern manufacturers and Western farmers forced
14379	Congress to make an upward revision of the tariff. The Act of 1828 known
14380	as "the Tariff of Abominations," though slightly modified in 1832, was
14381	"the straw which broke the camel's back." Southern leaders turned in
14382	rage against the whole system. The legislatures of Virginia, North
14383	Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama denounced it; a general
14384	convention of delegates held at Augusta issued a protest of defiance
14385	against it; and South Carolina, weary of verbal battles, decided to
14386	prevent its enforcement.
14387	
14388	_South Carolina Nullifies the Tariff._--The legislature of that state,
14389	on October 26, 1832, passed a bill calling for a state convention which
14390	duly assembled in the following month. In no mood for compromise, it
14391	adopted the famous Ordinance of Nullification after a few days' debate.
14392	Every line of this document was clear and firm. The tariff, it opened,
14393	gives "bounties to classes and individuals ... at the expense and to the
14394	injury and oppression of other classes and individuals"; it is a
14395	violation of the Constitution of the United States and therefore null
14396	and void; its enforcement in South Carolina is unlawful; if the federal
14397	government attempts to coerce the state into obeying the law, "the
14398	people of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all
14399	further obligations to maintain or preserve their political connection
14400	with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to
14401	organize a separate government and do all other acts and things which
14402	sovereign and independent states may of right do."
14403	
14404	_Southern States Condemn Nullification._--The answer of the country to
14405	this note of defiance, couched in the language used in the Kentucky
14406	resolutions and by the New England Federalists during the war of 1812,
14407	was quick and positive. The legislatures of the Southern states, while
14408	condemning the tariff, repudiated the step which South Carolina had
14409	taken. Georgia responded: "We abhor the doctrine of nullification as
14410	neither a peaceful nor a constitutional remedy." Alabama found it
14411	"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice." North Carolina replied
14412	that it was "revolutionary in character, subversive of the Constitution
14413	of the United States." Mississippi answered: "It is disunion by
14414	force--it is civil war." Virginia spoke more softly, condemning the
14415	tariff and sustaining the principle of the Virginia resolutions but
14416	denying that South Carolina could find in them any sanction for her
14417	proceedings.
14418	
14419	_Jackson Firmly Upholds the Union._--The eyes of the country were turned
14420	upon Andrew Jackson. It was known that he looked with no friendly
14421	feelings upon nullification, for, at a Jefferson dinner in the spring of
14422	1830 while the subject was in the air, he had with laconic firmness
14423	announced a toast: "Our federal union; it must be preserved." When two
14424	years later the open challenge came from South Carolina, he replied that
14425	he would enforce the law, saying with his frontier directness: "If a
14426	single drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of
14427	the United States, I will hang the first man I can lay my hands on
14428	engaged in such conduct upon the first tree that I can reach." He made
14429	ready to keep his word by preparing for the use of military and naval
14430	forces in sustaining the authority of the federal government. Then in a
14431	long and impassioned proclamation to the people of South Carolina he
14432	pointed out the national character of the union, and announced his
14433	solemn resolve to preserve it by all constitutional means. Nullification
14434	he branded as "incompatible with the existence of the union,
14435	contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized
14436	by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was
14437	founded, and destructive of the great objects for which it was formed."
14438	
14439	_A Compromise._--In his messages to Congress, however, Jackson spoke the
14440	language of conciliation. A few days before issuing his proclamation he
14441	suggested that protection should be limited to the articles of domestic
14442	manufacture indispensable to safety in war time, and shortly afterward
14443	he asked for new legislation to aid him in enforcing the laws. With two
14444	propositions before it, one to remove the chief grounds for South
14445	Carolina's resistance and the other to apply force if it was continued,
14446	Congress bent its efforts to avoid a crisis. On February 12, 1833,
14447	Henry Clay laid before the Senate a compromise tariff bill providing for
14448	the gradual reduction of the duties until by 1842 they would reach the
14449	level of the law which Calhoun had supported in 1816. About the same
14450	time the "force bill," designed to give the President ample authority in
14451	executing the law in South Carolina, was taken up. After a short but
14452	acrimonious debate, both measures were passed and signed by President
14453	Jackson on the same day, March 2. Looking upon the reduction of the
14454	tariff as a complete vindication of her policy and an undoubted victory,
14455	South Carolina rescinded her ordinance and enacted another nullifying
14456	the force bill.

14460	DANIEL WEBSTER]
14461	
14462	_The Webster-Hayne Debate._--Where the actual victory lay in this
14463	quarrel, long the subject of high dispute, need not concern us to-day.
14464	Perhaps the chief result of the whole affair was a clarification of the
14465	issue between the North and the South--a definite statement of the
14466	principles for which men on both sides were years afterward to lay down
14467	their lives. On behalf of nationalism and a perpetual union, the stanch
14468	old Democrat from Tennessee had, in his proclamation on nullification,
14469	spoken a language that admitted of only one meaning. On behalf of
14470	nullification, Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, a skilled lawyer and
14471	courtly orator, had in a great speech delivered in the Senate in
14472	January, 1830, set forth clearly and cogently the doctrine that the
14473	union is a compact among sovereign states from which the parties may
14474	lawfully withdraw. It was this address that called into the arena
14475	Daniel Webster, Senator from Massachusetts, who, spreading the mantle
14476	of oblivion over the Hartford convention, delivered a reply to Hayne
14477	that has been reckoned among the powerful orations of all time--a plea
14478	for the supremacy of the Constitution and the national character of the
14479	union.
14480	
14481	=The War on the United States Bank.=--If events forced the issue of
14482	nationalism and nullification upon Jackson, the same could not be said
14483	of his attack on the bank. That institution, once denounced by every
14484	true Jeffersonian, had been reestablished in 1816 under the
14485	administration of Jefferson's disciple, James Madison. It had not been
14486	in operation very long, however, before it aroused bitter opposition,
14487	especially in the South and the West. Its notes drove out of circulation
14488	the paper currency of unsound banks chartered by the states, to the
14489	great anger of local financiers. It was accused of favoritism in making
14490	loans, of conferring special privileges upon politicians in return for
14491	their support at Washington. To all Jackson's followers it was "an
14492	insidious money power." One of them openly denounced it as an
14493	institution designed "to strengthen the arm of wealth and counterpoise
14494	the influence of extended suffrage in the disposition of public
14495	affairs."
14496	
14497	This sentiment President Jackson fully shared. In his first message to
14498	Congress he assailed the bank in vigorous language. He declared that its
14499	constitutionality was in doubt and alleged that it had failed to
14500	establish a sound and uniform currency. If such an institution was
14501	necessary, he continued, it should be a public bank, owned and managed
14502	by the government, not a private concern endowed with special privileges
14503	by it. In his second and third messages, Jackson came back to the
14504	subject, leaving the decision, however, to "an enlightened people and
14505	their representatives."
14506	
14507	Moved by this frank hostility and anxious for the future, the bank
14508	applied to Congress for a renewal of its charter in 1832, four years
14509	before the expiration of its life. Clay, with his eye upon the
14510	presidency and an issue for the campaign, warmly supported the
14511	application. Congress, deeply impressed by his leadership, passed the
14512	bill granting the new charter, and sent the open defiance to Jackson.
14513	His response was an instant veto. The battle was on and it raged with
14514	fury until the close of his second administration, ending in the
14515	destruction of the bank, a disordered currency, and a national panic.
14516	
14517	In his veto message, Jackson attacked the bank as unconstitutional and
14518	even hinted at corruption. He refused to assent to the proposition that
14519	the Supreme Court had settled the question of constitutionality by the
14520	decision in the McCulloch case. "Each public officer," he argued, "who
14521	takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support
14522	it as he understands it, not as it is understood by others."
14523	
14524	Not satisfied with his veto and his declaration against the bank,
14525	Jackson ordered the Secretary of the Treasury to withdraw the government
14526	deposits which formed a large part of the institution's funds. This
14527	action he followed up by an open charge that the bank had used money
14528	shamefully to secure the return of its supporters to Congress. The
14529	Senate, stung by this charge, solemnly resolved that Jackson had
14530	"assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the
14531	Constitution and laws, but in derogation of both."
14532	
14533	The effects of the destruction of the bank were widespread. When its
14534	charter expired in 1836, banking was once more committed to the control
14535	of the states. The state legislatures, under a decision rendered by the
14536	Supreme Court after the death of Marshall, began to charter banks under
14537	state ownership and control, with full power to issue paper money--this
14538	in spite of the provision in the Constitution that states shall not
14539	issue bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin legal
14540	tender in the payment of debts. Once more the country was flooded by
14541	paper currency of uncertain value. To make matters worse, Jackson
14542	adopted the practice of depositing huge amounts of government funds in
14543	these banks, not forgetting to render favors to those institutions which
14544	supported him in politics--"pet banks," as they were styled at the
14545	time. In 1837, partially, though by no means entirely, as a result of
14546	the abolition of the bank, the country was plunged into one of the most
14547	disastrous panics which it ever experienced.
14548	
14549	=Internal Improvements Checked.=--The bank had presented to Jackson a
14550	very clear problem--one of destruction. Other questions were not so
14551	simple, particularly the subject of federal appropriations in aid of
14552	roads and other internal improvements. Jefferson had strongly favored
14553	government assistance in such matters, but his administration was
14554	followed by a reaction. Both Madison and Monroe vetoed acts of Congress
14555	appropriating public funds for public roads, advancing as their reason
14556	the argument that the Constitution authorized no such laws. Jackson,
14557	puzzled by the clamor on both sides, followed their example without
14558	making the constitutional bar absolute. Congress, he thought, might
14559	lawfully build highways of a national and military value, but he
14560	strongly deprecated attacks by local interests on the federal treasury.
14561	
14562	=The Triumph of the Executive Branch.=--Jackson's reelection in 1832
14563	served to confirm his opinion that he was the chosen leader of the
14564	people, freed and instructed to ride rough shod over Congress and even
14565	the courts. No President before or since ever entertained in times of
14566	peace such lofty notions of executive prerogative. The entire body of
14567	federal employees he transformed into obedient servants of his wishes, a
14568	sign or a nod from him making and undoing the fortunes of the humble and
14569	the mighty. His lawful cabinet of advisers, filling all of the high
14570	posts in the government, he treated with scant courtesy, preferring
14571	rather to secure his counsel and advice from an unofficial body of
14572	friends and dependents who, owing to their secret methods and back
14573	stairs arrangements, became known as "the kitchen cabinet." Under the
14574	leadership of a silent, astute, and resourceful politician, Amos
14575	Kendall, this informal gathering of the faithful both gave and carried
14576	out decrees and orders, communicating the President's lightest wish or
14577	strictest command to the uttermost part of the country. Resolutely and
14578	in the face of bitter opposition Jackson had removed the deposits from
14579	the United States Bank. When the Senate protested against this arbitrary
14580	conduct, he did not rest until it was forced to expunge the resolution
14581	of condemnation; in time one of his lieutenants with his own hands was
14582	able to tear the censure from the records. When Chief Justice Marshall
14583	issued a decree against Georgia which did not suit him, Jackson,
14584	according to tradition, blurted out that Marshall could go ahead and
14585	enforce his own orders. To the end he pursued his willful way, finally
14586	even choosing his own successor.
14587	
14588	
14589	THE RISE OF THE WHIGS
14590	
14591	=Jackson's Measures Arouse Opposition.=--Measures so decided, policies
14592	so radical, and conduct so high-handed could not fail to arouse against
14593	Jackson a deep and exasperated opposition. The truth is the conduct of
14594	his entire administration profoundly disturbed the business and finances
14595	of the country. It was accompanied by conditions similar to those which
14596	existed under the Articles of Confederation. A paper currency, almost as
14597	unstable and irritating as the worthless notes of revolutionary days,
14598	flooded the country, hindering the easy transaction of business. The use
14599	of federal funds for internal improvements, so vital to the exchange of
14600	commodities which is the very life of industry, was blocked by executive
14601	vetoes. The Supreme Court, which, under Marshall, had held refractory
14602	states to their obligations under the Constitution, was flouted; states'
14603	rights judges, deliberately selected by Jackson for the bench, began to
14604	sap and undermine the rulings of Marshall. The protective tariff, under
14605	which the textile industry of New England, the iron mills of
14606	Pennsylvania, and the wool, flax, and hemp farms of the West had
14607	flourished, had received a severe blow in the compromise of 1833 which
14608	promised a steady reduction of duties. To cap the climax, Jackson's
14609	party, casting aside the old and reputable name of Republican, boldly
14610	chose for its title the term "Democrat," throwing down the gauntlet to
14611	every conservative who doubted the omniscience of the people. All these
14612	things worked together to evoke an opposition that was sharp and
14613	determined.
14614	
14615	[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON RIDICULING CLAY'S TARIFF AND INTERNAL
14616	IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM]
14617	
14618	=Clay and the National Republicans.=--In this opposition movement,
14619	leadership fell to Henry Clay, a son of Kentucky, rather than to Daniel
14620	Webster of Massachusetts. Like Jackson, Clay was born in a home haunted
14621	by poverty. Left fatherless early and thrown upon his own resources, he
14622	went from Virginia into Kentucky where by sheer force of intellect he
14623	rose to eminence in the profession of law. Without the martial gifts or
14624	the martial spirit of Jackson, he slipped more easily into the social
14625	habits of the East at the same time that he retained his hold on the
14626	affections of the boisterous West. Farmers of Ohio, Indiana, and
14627	Kentucky loved him; financiers of New York and Philadelphia trusted him.
14628	He was thus a leader well fitted to gather the forces of opposition
14629	into union against Jackson.
14630	
14631	Around Clay's standard assembled a motley collection, representing every
14632	species of political opinion, united by one tie only--hatred for "Old
14633	Hickory." Nullifiers and less strenuous advocates of states' rights were
14634	yoked with nationalists of Webster's school; ardent protectionists were
14635	bound together with equally ardent free traders, all fraternizing in one
14636	grand confusion of ideas under the title of "National Republicans." Thus
14637	the ancient and honorable term selected by Jefferson and his party, now
14638	abandoned by Jacksonian Democracy, was adroitly adopted to cover the
14639	supporters of Clay. The platform of the party, however, embraced all the
14640	old Federalist principles: protection for American industry; internal
14641	improvements; respect for the Supreme Court; resistance to executive
14642	tyranny; and denunciation of the spoils system. Though Jackson was
14643	easily victorious in 1832, the popular vote cast for Clay should have
14644	given him some doubts about the faith of "the whole people" in the
14645	wisdom of his "reign."
14646	
14647	=Van Buren and the Panic of 1837.=--Nothing could shake the General's
14648	superb confidence. At the end of his second term he insisted on
14649	selecting his own successor; at a national convention, chosen by party
14650	voters, but packed with his office holders and friends, he nominated
14651	Martin Van Buren of New York. Once more he proved his strength by
14652	carrying the country for the Democrats. With a fine flourish, he
14653	attended the inauguration of Van Buren and then retired, amid the
14654	applause and tears of his devotees, to the Hermitage, his home in
14655	Tennessee.
14656	
14657	Fortunately for him, Jackson escaped the odium of a disastrous panic
14658	which struck the country with terrible force in the following summer.
14659	Among the contributory causes of this crisis, no doubt, were the
14660	destruction of the bank and the issuance of the "specie circular" of
14661	
14662	1836 which required the purchasers of public lands to pay for them in
14663	coin, instead of the paper notes of state banks. Whatever the dominating
14664	cause, the ruin was widespread. Bank after bank went under; boom towns
14665	in the West collapsed; Eastern mills shut down; and working people in
14666	the industrial centers, starving from unemployment, begged for relief.
14667	Van Buren braved the storm, offering no measure of reform or assistance
14668	to the distracted people. He did seek security for government funds by
14669	suggesting the removal of deposits from private banks and the
14670	establishment of an independent treasury system, with government
14671	depositaries for public funds, in several leading cities. This plan was
14672	finally accepted by Congress in 1840.
14673	
14674	Had Van Buren been a captivating figure he might have lived down the
14675	discredit of the panic unjustly laid at his door; but he was far from
14676	being a favorite with the populace. Though a man of many talents, he
14677	owed his position to the quiet and adept management of Jackson rather
14678	than to his own personal qualities. The men of the frontier did not care
14679	for him. They suspected that he ate from "gold plate" and they could not
14680	forgive him for being an astute politician from New York. Still the
14681	Democratic party, remembering Jackson's wishes, renominated him
14682	unanimously in 1840 and saw him go down to utter defeat.
14683	
14684	=The Whigs and General Harrison.=--By this time, the National
14685	Republicans, now known as Whigs--a title taken from the party of
14686	opposition to the Crown in England, had learned many lessons. Taking a
14687	leaf out of the Democratic book, they nominated, not Clay of Kentucky,
14688	well known for his views on the bank, the tariff, and internal
14689	improvements, but a military hero, General William Henry Harrison, a man
14690	of uncertain political opinions. Harrison, a son of a Virginia signer of
14691	the Declaration of Independence, sprang into public view by winning a
14692	battle more famous than important, "Tippecanoe"--a brush with the
14693	Indians in Indiana. He added to his laurels by rendering praiseworthy
14694	services during the war of 1812. When days of peace returned he was
14695	rewarded by a grateful people with a seat in Congress. Then he retired
14696	to quiet life in a little village near Cincinnati. Like Jackson he was
14697	held to be a son of the South and the West. Like Jackson he was a
14698	military hero, a lesser light, but still a light. Like Old Hickory he
14699	rode into office on a tide of popular feeling against an Eastern man
14700	accused of being something of an aristocrat. His personal popularity was
14701	sufficient. The Whigs who nominated him shrewdly refused to adopt a
14702	platform or declare their belief in anything. When some Democrat
14703	asserted that Harrison was a backwoodsman whose sole wants were a jug of
14704	hard cider and a log cabin, the Whigs treated the remark not as an
14705	insult but as proof positive that Harrison deserved the votes of Jackson
14706	men. The jug and the cabin they proudly transformed into symbols of the
14707	campaign, and won for their chieftain 234 electoral votes, while Van
14708	Buren got only sixty.
14709	
14710	=Harrison and Tyler.=--The Hero of Tippecanoe was not long to enjoy the
14711	fruits of his victory. The hungry horde of Whig office seekers descended
14712	upon him like wolves upon the fold. If he went out they waylaid him; if
14713	he stayed indoors, he was besieged; not even his bed chamber was spared.
14714	He was none too strong at best and he took a deep cold on the day of his
14715	inauguration. Between driving out Democrats and appeasing Whigs, he fell
14716	mortally ill. Before the end of a month he lay dead at the capitol.
14717	
14718	Harrison's successor, John Tyler, the Vice President, whom the Whigs had
14719	nominated to catch votes in Virginia, was more of a Democrat than
14720	anything else, though he was not partisan enough to please anybody. The
14721	Whigs railed at him because he would not approve the founding of another
14722	United States Bank. The Democrats stormed at him for refusing, until
14723	near the end of his term, to sanction the annexation of Texas, which had
14724	declared its independence of Mexico in 1836. His entire administration,
14725	marked by unseemly wrangling, produced only two measures of importance.
14726	The Whigs, flushed by victory, with the aid of a few protectionist
14727	Democrats, enacted, in 1842, a new tariff law destroying the compromise
14728	which had brought about the truce between the North and the South, in
14729	the days of nullification. The distinguished leader of the Whigs, Daniel
14730	Webster, as Secretary of State, in negotiation with Lord Ashburton
14731	representing Great Britain, settled the long-standing dispute between
14732	the two countries over the Maine boundary. A year after closing this
14733	chapter in American diplomacy, Webster withdrew to private life, leaving
14734	the President to endure alone the buffets of political fortune.
14735	
14736	To the end, the Whigs regarded Tyler as a traitor to their cause; but
14737	the judgment of history is that it was a case of the biter bitten. They
14738	had nominated him for the vice presidency as a man of views acceptable
14739	to Southern Democrats in order to catch their votes, little reckoning
14740	with the chances of his becoming President. Tyler had not deceived them
14741	and, thoroughly soured, he left the White House in 1845 not to appear in
14742	public life again until the days of secession, when he espoused the
14743	Southern confederacy. Jacksonian Democracy, with new leadership, serving
14744	a new cause--slavery--was returned to power under James K. Polk, a
14745	friend of the General from Tennessee. A few grains of sand were to run
14746	through the hour glass before the Whig party was to be broken and
14747	scattered as the Federalists had been more than a generation before.
14748	
14749	
14750	THE INTERACTION OF AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN OPINION
14751	
14752	=Democracy in England and France.=--During the period of Jacksonian
14753	Democracy, as in all epochs of ferment, there was a close relation
14754	between the thought of the New World and the Old. In England, the
14755	successes of the American experiment were used as arguments in favor of
14756	overthrowing the aristocracy which George III had manipulated with such
14757	effect against America half a century before. In the United States, on
14758	the other hand, conservatives like Chancellor Kent, the stout opponent
14759	of manhood suffrage in New York, cited the riots of the British working
14760	classes as a warning against admitting the same classes to a share in
14761	the government of the United States. Along with the agitation of opinion
14762	went epoch-making events. In 1832, the year of Jackson's second
14763	triumph, the British Parliament passed its first reform bill, which
14764	conferred the ballot--not on workingmen as yet--but on mill owners and
14765	shopkeepers whom the landlords regarded with genuine horror. The initial
14766	step was thus taken in breaking down the privileges of the landed
14767	aristocracy and the rich merchants of England.
14768	
14769	About the same time a popular revolution occurred in France. The Bourbon
14770	family, restored to the throne of France by the allied powers after
14771	their victory over Napoleon in 1815, had embarked upon a policy of
14772	arbitrary government. To use the familiar phrase, they had learned
14773	nothing and forgotten nothing. Charles X, who came to the throne in
14774	1824, set to work with zeal to undo the results of the French
14775	Revolution, to stifle the press, restrict the suffrage, and restore the
14776	clergy and the nobility to their ancient rights. His policy encountered
14777	equally zealous opposition and in 1830 he was overthrown. The popular
14778	party, under the leadership of Lafayette, established, not a republic as
14779	some of the radicals had hoped, but a "liberal" middle-class monarchy
14780	under Louis Philippe. This second French Revolution made a profound
14781	impression on Americans, convincing them that the whole world was moving
14782	toward democracy. The mayor, aldermen, and citizens of New York City
14783	joined in a great parade to celebrate the fall of the Bourbons. Mingled
14784	with cheers for the new order in France were hurrahs for "the people's
14785	own, Andrew Jackson, the Hero of New Orleans and President of the United
14786	States!"
14787	
14788	=European Interest in America.=--To the older and more settled
14789	Europeans, the democratic experiment in America was either a menace or
14790	an inspiration. Conservatives viewed it with anxiety; liberals with
14791	optimism. Far-sighted leaders could see that the tide of democracy was
14792	rising all over the world and could not be stayed. Naturally the country
14793	that had advanced furthest along the new course was the place in which
14794	to find arguments for and against proposals that Europe should make
14795	experiments of the same character.
14796	
14797	=De Tocqueville's _Democracy in America_.=--In addition to the casual
14798	traveler there began to visit the United States the thoughtful observer
14799	bent on finding out what manner of nation this was springing up in the
14800	wilderness. Those who looked with sympathy upon the growing popular
14801	forces of England and France found in the United States, in spite of
14802	many blemishes and defects, a guarantee for the future of the people's
14803	rule in the Old World. One of these, Alexis de Tocqueville, a French
14804	liberal of mildly democratic sympathies, made a journey to this country
14805	in 1831; he described in a very remarkable volume, _Democracy in
14806	America_, the grand experiment as he saw it. On the whole he was
14807	convinced. After examining with a critical eye the life and labor of the
14808	American people, as well as the constitutions of the states and the
14809	nation, he came to the conclusion that democracy with all its faults was
14810	both inevitable and successful. Slavery he thought was a painful
14811	contrast to the other features of American life, and he foresaw what
14812	proved to be the irrepressible conflict over it. He believed that
14813	through blundering the people were destined to learn the highest of all
14814	arts, self-government on a grand scale. The absence of a leisure class,
14815	devoted to no calling or profession, merely enjoying the refinements of
14816	life and adding to its graces--the flaw in American culture that gave
14817	deep distress to many a European leader--de Tocqueville thought a
14818	necessary virtue in the republic. "Amongst a democratic people where
14819	there is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living, or has
14820	worked, or is born of parents who have worked. A notion of labor is
14821	therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary, natural,
14822	and honest condition of human existence." It was this notion of a
14823	government in the hands of people who labored that struck the French
14824	publicist as the most significant fact in the modern world.
14825	
14826	=Harriet Martineau's Visit to America.=--This phase of American life
14827	also profoundly impressed the brilliant English writer, Harriet
14828	Martineau. She saw all parts of the country, the homes of the rich and
14829	the log cabins of the frontier; she traveled in stagecoaches, canal
14830	boats, and on horseback; and visited sessions of Congress and auctions
14831	at slave markets. She tried to view the country impartially and the
14832	thing that left the deepest mark on her mind was the solidarity of the
14833	people in one great political body. "However various may be the tribes
14834	of inhabitants in those states, whatever part of the world may have been
14835	their birthplace, or that of their fathers, however broken may be their
14836	language, however servile or noble their employments, however exalted or
14837	despised their state, all are declared to be bound together by equal
14838	political obligations.... In that self-governing country all are held to
14839	have an equal interest in the principles of its institutions and to be
14840	bound in equal duty to watch their workings." Miss Martineau was also
14841	impressed with the passion of Americans for land ownership and
14842	contrasted the United States favorably with England where the tillers of
14843	the soil were either tenants or laborers for wages.
14844	
14845	=Adverse Criticism.=--By no means all observers and writers were
14846	convinced that America was a success. The fastidious traveler, Mrs.
14847	Trollope, who thought the English system of church and state was ideal,
14848	saw in the United States only roughness and ignorance. She lamented the
14849	"total and universal want of manners both in males and females," adding
14850	that while "they appear to have clear heads and active intellects,"
14851	there was "no charm, no grace in their conversation." She found
14852	everywhere a lack of reverence for kings, learning, and rank. Other
14853	critics were even more savage. The editor of the _Foreign Quarterly_
14854	petulantly exclaimed that the United States was "a brigand
14855	confederation." Charles Dickens declared the country to be "so maimed
14856	and lame, so full of sores and ulcers that her best friends turn from
14857	the loathsome creature in disgust." Sydney Smith, editor of the
14858	_Edinburgh Review_, was never tired of trying his caustic wit at the
14859	expense of America. "Their Franklins and Washingtons and all the other
14860	sages and heroes of their revolution were born and bred subjects of the
14861	king of England," he observed in 1820. "During the thirty or forty
14862	years of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for the
14863	sciences, for the arts, for literature, or even for the statesmanlike
14864	studies of politics or political economy.... In the four quarters of the
14865	globe who reads an American book? Or goes to an American play? Or looks
14866	at an American picture or statue?" To put a sharp sting into his taunt
14867	he added, forgetting by whose authority slavery was introduced and
14868	fostered: "Under which of the old tyrannical governments of Europe is
14869	every sixth man a slave whom his fellow creatures may buy and sell?"
14870	
14871	Some Americans, while resenting the hasty and often superficial
14872	judgments of European writers, winced under their satire and took
14873	thought about certain particulars in the indictments brought against
14874	them. The mass of the people, however, bent on the great experiment,
14875	gave little heed to carping critics who saw the flaws and not the
14876	achievements of our country--critics who were in fact less interested in
14877	America than in preventing the rise and growth of democracy in Europe.

14969	CHAPTER XII
14970	
14971	THE MIDDLE BORDER AND THE GREAT WEST
14972	
14973	
14974	"We shall not send an emigrant beyond the Mississippi in a hundred
14975	years," exclaimed Livingston, the principal author of the Louisiana
14976	purchase. When he made this astounding declaration, he doubtless had
14977	before his mind's eye the great stretches of unoccupied lands between
14978	the Appalachians and the Mississippi. He also had before him the history
14979	of the English colonies, which told him of the two centuries required to
14980	settle the seaboard region. To practical men, his prophecy did not seem
14981	far wrong; but before the lapse of half that time there appeared beyond
14982	the Mississippi a tier of new states, reaching from the Gulf of Mexico
14983	to the southern boundary of Minnesota, and a new commonwealth on the
14984	Pacific Ocean where American emigrants had raised the Bear flag of
14985	California.
14986	
14987	
14988	THE ADVANCE OF THE MIDDLE BORDER
14989	
14990	=Missouri.=--When the middle of the nineteenth century had been reached,
14991	the Mississippi River, which Daniel Boone, the intrepid hunter, had
14992	crossed during Washington's administration "to escape from civilization"
14993	in Kentucky, had become the waterway for a vast empire. The center of
14994	population of the United States had passed to the Ohio Valley. Missouri,
14995	with its wide reaches of rich lands, low-lying, level, and fertile, well
14996	adapted to hemp raising, had drawn to its borders thousands of planters
14997	from the old Southern states--from Virginia and the Carolinas as well as
14998	from Kentucky and Tennessee. When the great compromise of 1820-21
14999	admitted her to the union, wearing "every jewel of sovereignty," as a
15000	florid orator announced, migratory slave owners were assured that their
15001	property would be safe in Missouri. Along the western shore of the
15002	Mississippi and on both banks of the Missouri to the uttermost limits of
15003	the state, plantations tilled by bondmen spread out in broad expanses.
15004	In the neighborhood of Jefferson City the slaves numbered more than a
15005	fourth of the population.
15006	
15007	Into this stream of migration from the planting South flowed another
15008	current of land-tilling farmers; some from Kentucky, Tennessee, and
15009	Mississippi, driven out by the onrush of the planters buying and
15010	consolidating small farms into vast estates; and still more from the
15011	East and the Old World. To the northwest over against Iowa and to the
15012	southwest against Arkansas, these yeomen laid out farms to be tilled by
15013	their own labor. In those regions the number of slaves seldom rose above
15014	five or six per cent of the population. The old French post, St. Louis,
15015	enriched by the fur trade of the Far West and the steamboat traffic of
15016	the river, grew into a thriving commercial city, including among its
15017	seventy-five thousand inhabitants in 1850 nearly forty thousand
15018	foreigners, German immigrants from Pennsylvania and Europe being the
15019	largest single element.
15020	
15021	=Arkansas.=--Below Missouri lay the territory of Arkansas, which had
15022	long been the paradise of the swarthy hunter and the restless
15023	frontiersman fleeing from the advancing borders of farm and town. In
15024	search of the life, wild and free, where the rifle supplied the game and
15025	a few acres of ground the corn and potatoes, they had filtered into the
15026	territory in an unending drift, "squatting" on the land. Without so much
15027	as asking the leave of any government, territorial or national, they
15028	claimed as their own the soil on which they first planted their feet.
15029	Like the Cherokee Indians, whom they had as neighbors, whose very
15030	customs and dress they sometimes adopted, the squatters spent their days
15031	in the midst of rough plenty, beset by chills, fevers, and the ills of
15032	the flesh, but for many years unvexed by political troubles or the
15033	restrictions of civilized life.
15034	
15035	Unfortunately for them, however, the fertile valleys of the Mississippi
15036	and Arkansas were well adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco
15037	and their sylvan peace was soon broken by an invasion of planters. The
15038	newcomers, with their servile workers, spread upward in the valley
15039	toward Missouri and along the southern border westward to the Red River.
15040	In time the slaves in the tier of counties against Louisiana ranged from
15041	thirty to seventy per cent of the population. This marked the doom of
15042	the small farmer, swept Arkansas into the main current of planting
15043	politics, and led to a powerful lobby at Washington in favor of
15044	admission to the union, a boon granted in 1836.
15045	
15046	=Michigan.=--In accordance with a well-established custom, a free state
15047	was admitted to the union to balance a slave state. In 1833, the people
15048	of Michigan, a territory ten times the size of Connecticut, announced
15049	that the time had come for them to enjoy the privileges of a
15050	commonwealth. All along the southern border the land had been occupied
15051	largely by pioneers from New England, who built prim farmhouses and
15052	adopted the town-meeting plan of self-government after the fashion of
15053	the old home. The famous post of Detroit was growing into a flourishing
15054	city as the boats plying on the Great Lakes carried travelers, settlers,
15055	and freight through the narrows. In all, according to the census, there
15056	were more than ninety thousand inhabitants in the territory; so it was
15057	not without warrant that they clamored for statehood. Congress, busy as
15058	ever with politics, delayed; and the inhabitants of Michigan, unable to
15059	restrain their impatience, called a convention, drew up a constitution,
15060	and started a lively quarrel with Ohio over the southern boundary. The
15061	hand of Congress was now forced. Objections were made to the new
15062	constitution on the ground that it gave the ballot to all free white
15063	males, including aliens not yet naturalized; but the protests were
15064	overborne in a long debate. The boundary was fixed, and Michigan, though
15065	shorn of some of the land she claimed, came into the union in 1837.
15066	
15067	=Wisconsin.=--Across Lake Michigan to the west lay the territory of
15068	Wisconsin, which shared with Michigan the interesting history of the
15069	Northwest, running back into the heroic days when French hunters and
15070	missionaries were planning a French empire for the great monarch, Louis
15071	XIV. It will not be forgotten that the French rangers of the woods, the
15072	black-robed priests, prepared for sacrifice, even to death, the trappers
15073	of the French agencies, and the French explorers--Marquette, Joliet, and
15074	Menard--were the first white men to paddle their frail barks through the
15075	northern waters. They first blazed their trails into the black forests
15076	and left traces of their work in the names of portages and little
15077	villages. It was from these forests that Red Men in full war paint
15078	journeyed far to fight under the _fleur-de-lis_ of France when the
15079	soldiers of King Louis made their last stand at Quebec and Montreal
15080	against the imperial arms of Britain. It was here that the British flag
15081	was planted in 1761 and that the great Pontiac conspiracy was formed two
15082	years later to overthrow British dominion.
15083	
15084	When, a generation afterward, the Stars and Stripes supplanted the Union
15085	Jack, the French were still almost the only white men in the region.
15086	They were soon joined by hustling Yankee fur traders who did battle
15087	royal against British interlopers. The traders cut their way through
15088	forest trails and laid out the routes through lake and stream and over
15089	portages for the settlers and their families from the states "back
15090	East." It was the forest ranger who discovered the water power later
15091	used to turn the busy mills grinding the grain from the spreading farm
15092	lands. In the wake of the fur hunters, forest men, and farmers came
15093	miners from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri crowding in to exploit the
15094	lead ores of the northwest, some of them bringing slaves to work their
15095	claims. Had it not been for the gold fever of 1849 that drew the
15096	wielders of pick and shovel to the Far West, Wisconsin would early have
15097	taken high rank among the mining regions of the country.
15098	
15099	From a favorable point of vantage on Lake Michigan, the village of
15100	Milwaukee, a center for lumber and grain transport and a place of entry
15101	for Eastern goods, grew into a thriving city. It claimed twenty thousand
15102	inhabitants, when in 1848 Congress admitted Wisconsin to the union.
15103	Already the Germans, Irish, and Scandinavians had found their way into
15104	the territory. They joined Americans from the older states in clearing
15105	forests, building roads, transforming trails into highways, erecting
15106	mills, and connecting streams with canals to make a network of routes
15107	for the traffic that poured to and from the Great Lakes.
15108	
15109	=Iowa and Minnesota.=--To the southwest of Wisconsin beyond the
15110	Mississippi, where the tall grass of the prairies waved like the sea,
15111	farmers from New England, New York, and Ohio had prepared Iowa for
15112	statehood. A tide of immigration that might have flowed into Missouri
15113	went northward; for freemen, unaccustomed to slavery and slave markets,
15114	preferred the open country above the compromise line. With incredible
15115	swiftness, they spread farms westward from the Mississippi. With Yankee
15116	ingenuity they turned to trading on the river, building before 1836
15117	three prosperous centers of traffic: Dubuque, Davenport, and Burlington.
15118	True to their old traditions, they founded colleges and academies that
15119	religion and learning might be cherished on the frontier as in the
15120	states from which they came. Prepared for self-government, the Iowans
15121	laid siege to the door of Congress and were admitted to the union in
15122	1846.
15123	
15124	Above Iowa, on the Mississippi, lay the territory of Minnesota--the home
15125	of the Dakotas, the Ojibways, and the Sioux. Like Michigan and
15126	Wisconsin, it had been explored early by the French scouts, and the
15127	first white settlement was the little French village of Mendota. To the
15128	people of the United States, the resources of the country were first
15129	revealed by the historic journey of Zebulon Pike in 1805 and by American
15130	fur traders who were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to ply
15131	their arts of hunting and bartering in fresh fields. In 1839 an
15132	American settlement was planted at Marina on the St. Croix, the outpost
15133	of advancing civilization. Within twenty years, the territory, boasting
15134	a population of 150,000, asked for admission to the union. In 1858 the
15135	plea was granted and Minnesota showed her gratitude three years later by
15136	being first among the states to offer troops to Lincoln in the hour of
15137	peril.
15138	
15139	
15140	ON TO THE PACIFIC--TEXAS AND THE MEXICAN WAR
15141	
15142	=The Uniformity of the Middle West.=--There was a certain monotony about
15143	pioneering in the Northwest and on the middle border. As the long
15144	stretches of land were cleared or prepared for the plow, they were laid
15145	out like checkerboards into squares of forty, eighty, one hundred sixty,
15146	or more acres, each the seat of a homestead. There was a striking
15147	uniformity also about the endless succession of fertile fields spreading
15148	far and wide under the hot summer sun. No majestic mountains relieved
15149	the sweep of the prairie. Few monuments of other races and antiquity
15150	were there to awaken curiosity about the region. No sonorous bells in
15151	old missions rang out the time of day. The chaffering Red Man bartering
15152	blankets and furs for powder and whisky had passed farther on. The
15153	population was made up of plain farmers and their families engaged in
15154	severe and unbroken labor, chopping down trees, draining fever-breeding
15155	swamps, breaking new ground, and planting from year to year the same
15156	rotation of crops. Nearly all the settlers were of native American stock
15157	into whose frugal and industrious lives the later Irish and German
15158	immigrants fitted, on the whole, with little friction. Even the Dutch
15159	oven fell before the cast-iron cooking stove. Happiness and sorrow,
15160	despair and hope were there, but all encompassed by the heavy tedium of
15161	prosaic sameness.
15162	
15163	[Illustration: SANTA BARBARA MISSION]
15164	
15165	=A Contrast in the Far West and Southwest.=--As George Rogers Clark and
15166	Daniel Boone had stirred the snug Americans of the seaboard to seek
15167	their fortunes beyond the Appalachians, so now Kit Carson, James Bowie,
15168	Sam Houston, Davy Crockett, and John C. Fremont were to lead the way
15169	into a new land, only a part of which was under the American flag. The
15170	setting for this new scene in the westward movement was thrown out in a
15171	wide sweep from the headwaters of the Mississippi to the banks of the
15172	Rio Grande; from the valleys of the Sabine and Red rivers to Montana and
15173	the Pacific slope. In comparison with the middle border, this region
15174	presented such startling diversities that only the eye of faith could
15175	foresee the unifying power of nationalism binding its communities with
15176	the older sections of the country. What contrasts indeed! The blue grass
15177	region of Kentucky or the rich, black soil of Illinois--the painted
15178	desert, the home of the sage brush and the coyote! The level prairies of
15179	Iowa--the mighty Rockies shouldering themselves high against the
15180	horizon! The long bleak winters of Wisconsin--California of endless
15181	summer! The log churches of Indiana or Illinois--the quaint missions of
15182	San Antonio, Tucson, and Santa Barbara! The little state of
15183	Delaware--the empire of Texas, one hundred and twenty times its area!
15184	And scattered about through the Southwest were signs of an ancient
15185	civilization--fragments of four-and five-story dwellings, ruined dams,
15186	aqueducts, and broken canals, which told of once prosperous peoples
15187	who, by art and science, had conquered the aridity of the desert and
15188	lifted themselves in the scale of culture above the savages of the
15189	plain.
15190	
15191	The settlers of this vast empire were to be as diverse in their origins
15192	and habits as those of the colonies on the coast had been. Americans of
15193	English, Irish, and Scotch-Irish descent came as usual from the Eastern
15194	states. To them were added the migratory Germans as well. Now for the
15195	first time came throngs of Scandinavians. Some were to make their homes
15196	on quiet farms as the border advanced against the setting sun. Others
15197	were to be Indian scouts, trappers, fur hunters, miners, cowboys, Texas
15198	planters, keepers of lonely posts on the plain and the desert, stage
15199	drivers, pilots of wagon trains, pony riders, fruit growers, "lumber
15200	jacks," and smelter workers. One common bond united them--a passion for
15201	the self-government accorded to states. As soon as a few thousand
15202	settlers came together in a single territory, there arose a mighty shout
15203	for a position beside the staid commonwealths of the East and the South.
15204	Statehood meant to the pioneers self-government, dignity, and the right
15205	to dispose of land, minerals, and timber in their own way. In the quest
15206	for this local autonomy there arose many a wordy contest in Congress,
15207	each of the political parties lending a helping hand in the admission of
15208	a state when it gave promise of adding new congressmen of the "right
15209	political persuasion," to use the current phrase.
15210	
15211	=Southern Planters and Texas.=--While the farmers of the North found the
15212	broad acres of the Western prairies stretching on before them apparently
15213	in endless expanse, it was far different with the Southern planters.
15214	Ever active in their search for new fields as they exhausted the virgin
15215	soil of the older states, the restless subjects of King Cotton quickly
15216	reached the frontier of Louisiana. There they paused; but only for a
15217	moment. The fertile land of Texas just across the boundary lured them on
15218	and the Mexican republic to which it belonged extended to them a more
15219	than generous welcome. Little realizing the perils lurking in a
15220	"peaceful penetration," the authorities at Mexico City opened wide the
15221	doors and made large grants of land to American contractors, who agreed
15222	to bring a number of families into Texas. The omnipresent Yankee, in the
15223	person of Moses Austin of Connecticut, hearing of this good news in the
15224	Southwest, obtained a grant in 1820 to settle three hundred Americans
15225	near Bexar--a commission finally carried out to the letter by his son
15226	and celebrated in the name given to the present capital of the state of
15227	Texas. Within a decade some twenty thousand Americans had crossed the
15228	border.
15229	
15230	=Mexico Closes the Door.=--The government of Mexico, unaccustomed to
15231	such enterprise and thoroughly frightened by its extent, drew back in
15232	dismay. Its fears were increased as quarrels broke out between the
15233	Americans and the natives in Texas. Fear grew into consternation when
15234	efforts were made by President Jackson to buy the territory for the
15235	United States. Mexico then sought to close the flood gates. It stopped
15236	all American colonization schemes, canceled many of the land grants, put
15237	a tariff on farming implements, and abolished slavery. These barriers
15238	were raised too late. A call for help ran through the western border of
15239	the United States. The sentinels of the frontier answered. Davy
15240	Crockett, the noted frontiersman, bear hunter, and backwoods politician;
15241	James Bowie, the dexterous wielder of the knife that to this day bears
15242	his name; and Sam Houston, warrior and pioneer, rushed to the aid of
15243	their countrymen in Texas. Unacquainted with the niceties of diplomacy,
15244	impatient at the formalities of international law, they soon made it
15245	known that in spite of Mexican sovereignty they would be their own
15246	masters.
15247	
15248	=The Independence of Texas Declared.=--Numbering only about one-fourth
15249	of the population in Texas, they raised the standard of revolt in 1836
15250	and summoned a convention. Following in the footsteps of their
15251	ancestors, they issued a declaration of independence signed mainly by
15252	Americans from the slave states. Anticipating that the government of
15253	Mexico would not quietly accept their word of defiance as final, they
15254	dispatched a force to repel "the invading army," as General Houston
15255	called the troops advancing under the command of Santa Ana, the Mexican
15256	president. A portion of the Texan soldiers took their stand in the
15257	Alamo, an old Spanish mission in the cottonwood trees in the town of San
15258	Antonio. Instead of obeying the order to blow up the mission and retire,
15259	they held their ground until they were completely surrounded and cut off
15260	from all help. Refusing to surrender, they fought to the bitter end, the
15261	last man falling a victim to the sword. Vengeance was swift. Within
15262	three months General Houston overwhelmed Santa Ana at the San Jacinto,
15263	taking him prisoner of war and putting an end to all hopes for the
15264	restoration of Mexican sovereignty over Texas.
15265	
15266	The Lone Star Republic, with Houston at the head, then sought admission
15267	to the United States. This seemed at first an easy matter. All that was
15268	required to bring it about appeared to be a treaty annexing Texas to the
15269	union. Moreover, President Jackson, at the height of his popularity, had
15270	a warm regard for General Houston and, with his usual sympathy for rough
15271	and ready ways of doing things, approved the transaction. Through an
15272	American representative in Mexico, Jackson had long and anxiously
15273	labored, by means none too nice, to wring from the Mexican republic the
15274	cession of the coveted territory. When the Texans took matters into
15275	their own hands, he was more than pleased; but he could not marshal the
15276	approval of two-thirds of the Senators required for a treaty of
15277	annexation. Cautious as well as impetuous, Jackson did not press the
15278	issue; he went out of office in 1837 with Texas uncertain as to her
15279	future.
15280	
15281	=Northern Opposition to Annexation.=--All through the North the
15282	opposition to annexation was clear and strong. Anti-slavery agitators
15283	could hardly find words savage enough to express their feelings.
15284	"Texas," exclaimed Channing in a letter to Clay, "is but the first step
15285	of aggression. I trust indeed that Providence will beat back and humble
15286	our cupidity and ambition. I now ask whether as a people we are
15287	prepared to seize on a neighboring territory for the end of extending
15288	slavery? I ask whether as a people we can stand forth in the sight of
15289	God, in the sight of nations, and adopt this atrocious policy? Sooner
15290	perish! Sooner be our name blotted out from the record of nations!"
15291	William Lloyd Garrison called for the secession of the Northern states
15292	if Texas was brought into the union with slavery. John Quincy Adams
15293	warned his countrymen that they were treading in the path of the
15294	imperialism that had brought the nations of antiquity to judgment and
15295	destruction. Henry Clay, the Whig candidate for President, taking into
15296	account changing public sentiment, blew hot and cold, losing the state
15297	of New York and the election of 1844 by giving a qualified approval of
15298	annexation. In the same campaign, the Democrats boldly demanded the
15299	"Reannexation of Texas," based on claims which the United States once
15300	had to Spanish territory beyond the Sabine River.
15301	
15302	=Annexation.=--The politicians were disposed to walk very warily. Van
15303	Buren, at heart opposed to slavery extension, refused to press the issue
15304	of annexation. Tyler, a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, by a strange
15305	fling of fortune carried into office as a nominal Whig, kept his mind
15306	firmly fixed on the idea of reelection and let the troublesome matter
15307	rest until the end of his administration was in sight. He then listened
15308	with favor to the voice of the South. Calhoun stated what seemed to be a
15309	convincing argument: All good Americans have their hearts set on the
15310	Constitution; the admission of Texas is absolutely essential to the
15311	preservation of the union; it will give a balance of power to the South
15312	as against the North growing with incredible swiftness in wealth and
15313	population. Tyler, impressed by the plea, appointed Calhoun to the
15314	office of Secretary of State in 1844, authorizing him to negotiate the
15315	treaty of annexation--a commission at once executed. This scheme was
15316	blocked in the Senate where the necessary two-thirds vote could not be
15317	secured. Balked but not defeated, the advocates of annexation drew up a
15318	joint resolution which required only a majority vote in both houses,
15319	and in February of the next year, just before Tyler gave way to Polk,
15320	they pushed it through Congress. So Texas, amid the groans of Boston and
15321	the hurrahs of Charleston, folded up her flag and came into the union.
15322	
15323	[Illustration: TEXAS AND THE TERRITORY IN DISPUTE]
15324	
15325	=The Mexican War.=--The inevitable war with Mexico, foretold by the
15326	abolitionists and feared by Henry Clay, ensued, the ostensible cause
15327	being a dispute over the boundaries of the new state. The Texans claimed
15328	all the lands down to the Rio Grande. The Mexicans placed the border of
15329	Texas at the Nueces River and a line drawn thence in a northerly
15330	direction. President Polk, accepting the Texan view of the controversy,
15331	ordered General Zachary Taylor to move beyond the Nueces in defense of
15332	American sovereignty. This act of power, deemed by the Mexicans an
15333	invasion of their territory, was followed by an attack on our troops.
15334	
15335	President Polk, not displeased with the turn of events, announced that
15336	American blood had been "spilled on American soil" and that war existed
15337	"by the act of Mexico." Congress, in a burst of patriotic fervor,
15338	brushed aside the protests of those who deplored the conduct of the
15339	government as wanton aggression on a weaker nation and granted money and
15340	supplies to prosecute the war. The few Whigs in the House of
15341	Representatives, who refused to vote in favor of taking up arms,
15342	accepted the inevitable with such good grace as they could command. All
15343	through the South and the West the war was popular. New England
15344	grumbled, but gave loyal, if not enthusiastic, support to a conflict
15345	precipitated by policies not of its own choosing. Only a handful of firm
15346	objectors held out. James Russell Lowell, in his _Biglow Papers_, flung
15347	scorn and sarcasm to the bitter end.
15348	
15349	=The Outcome of the War.=--The foregone conclusion was soon reached.
15350	General Taylor might have delivered the fatal thrust from northern
15351	Mexico if politics had not intervened. Polk, anxious to avoid raising up
15352	another military hero for the Whigs to nominate for President, decided
15353	to divide the honors by sending General Scott to strike a blow at the
15354	capital, Mexico City. The deed was done with speed and pomp and two
15355	heroes were lifted into presidential possibilities. In the Far West a
15356	third candidate was made, John C. Fremont, who, in cooperation with
15357	Commodores Sloat and Stockton and General Kearney, planted the Stars and
15358	Stripes on the Pacific slope.
15359	
15360	In February, 1848, the Mexicans came to terms, ceding to the victor
15361	California, Arizona, New Mexico, and more--a domain greater in extent
15362	than the combined areas of France and Germany. As a salve to the wound,
15363	the vanquished received fifteen million dollars in cash and the
15364	cancellation of many claims held by American citizens. Five years later,
15365	through the negotiations of James Gadsden, a further cession of lands
15366	along the southern border of Arizona and New Mexico was secured on
15367	payment of ten million dollars.
15368	
15369	=General Taylor Elected President.=--The ink was hardly dry upon the
15370	treaty that closed the war before "rough and ready" General Taylor, a
15371	slave owner from Louisiana, "a Whig," as he said, "but not an ultra
15372	Whig," was put forward as the Whig candidate for President. He himself
15373	had not voted for years and he was fairly innocent in matters political.
15374	The tariff, the currency, and internal improvements, with a magnificent
15375	gesture he referred to the people's representatives in Congress,
15376	offering to enforce the laws as made, if elected. Clay's followers
15377	mourned. Polk stormed but could not win even a renomination at the hands
15378	of the Democrats. So it came about that the hero of Buena Vista,
15379	celebrated for his laconic order, "Give 'em a little more grape, Captain
15380	Bragg," became President of the United States.
15381	
15382	
15383	THE PACIFIC COAST AND UTAH
15384	
15385	=Oregon.=--Closely associated in the popular mind with the contest about
15386	the affairs of Texas was a dispute with Great Britain over the
15387	possession of territory in Oregon. In their presidential campaign of
15388	1844, the Democrats had coupled with the slogan, "The Reannexation of
15389	Texas," two other cries, "The Reoccupation of Oregon," and "Fifty-four
15390	Forty or Fight." The last two slogans were founded on American
15391	discoveries and explorations in the Far Northwest. Their appearance in
15392	politics showed that the distant Oregon country, larger in area than New
15393	England, New York, and Pennsylvania combined, was at last receiving from
15394	the nation the attention which its importance warranted.
15395	
15396	_Joint Occupation and Settlement._--Both England and the United States
15397	had long laid claim to Oregon and in 1818 they had agreed to occupy the
15398	territory jointly--a contract which was renewed ten years later for an
15399	indefinite period. Under this plan, citizens of both countries were free
15400	to hunt and settle anywhere in the region. The vanguard of British fur
15401	traders and Canadian priests was enlarged by many new recruits, with
15402	Americans not far behind them. John Jacob Astor, the resourceful New
15403	York merchant, sent out trappers and hunters who established a trading
15404	post at Astoria in 1811. Some twenty years later, American
15405	missionaries--among them two very remarkable men, Jason Lee and Marcus
15406	Whitman--were preaching the gospel to the Indians.
15407	
15408	Through news from the fur traders and missionaries, Eastern farmers
15409	heard of the fertile lands awaiting their plows on the Pacific slope;
15410	those with the pioneering spirit made ready to take possession of the
15411	new country. In 1839 a band went around by Cape Horn. Four years later a
15412	great expedition went overland. The way once broken, others followed
15413	rapidly. As soon as a few settlements were well established, the
15414	pioneers held a mass meeting and agreed upon a plan of government. "We,
15415	the people of Oregon territory," runs the preamble to their compact,
15416	"for the purposes of mutual protection and to secure peace and
15417	prosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the following laws and
15418	regulations until such time as the United States of America extend their
15419	jurisdiction over us." Thus self-government made its way across the
15420	Rocky Mountains.
15421	
15422	[Illustration: THE OREGON COUNTRY AND THE DISPUTED BOUNDARY]
15423	
15424	_The Boundary Dispute with England Adjusted._--By this time it was
15425	evident that the boundaries of Oregon must be fixed. Having made the
15426	question an issue in his campaign, Polk, after his election in 1844,
15427	pressed it upon the attention of the country. In his inaugural address
15428	and his first message to Congress he reiterated the claim of the
15429	Democratic platform that "our title to the whole territory of Oregon is
15430	clear and unquestionable." This pretension Great Britain firmly
15431	rejected, leaving the President a choice between war and compromise.
15432	
15433	Polk, already having the contest with Mexico on his hands, sought and
15434	obtained a compromise. The British government, moved by a hint from the
15435	American minister, offered a settlement which would fix the boundary at
15436	the forty-ninth parallel instead of "fifty-four forty," and give it
15437	Vancouver Island. Polk speedily chose this way out of the dilemma.
15438	Instead of making the decision himself, however, and drawing up a
15439	treaty, he turned to the Senate for "counsel." As prearranged with party
15440	leaders, the advice was favorable to the plan. The treaty, duly drawn in
15441	1846, was ratified by the Senate after an acrimonious debate. "Oh!
15442	mountain that was delivered of a mouse," exclaimed Senator Benton, "thy
15443	name shall be fifty-four forty!" Thirteen years later, the southern part
15444	of the territory was admitted to the union as the state of Oregon,
15445	leaving the northern and eastern sections in the status of a territory.
15446	
15447	=California.=--With the growth of the northwestern empire, dedicated by
15448	nature to freedom, the planting interests might have been content, had
15449	fortune not wrested from them the fair country of California. Upon this
15450	huge territory they had set their hearts. The mild climate and fertile
15451	soil seemed well suited to slavery and the planters expected to extend
15452	their sway to the entire domain. California was a state of more than
15453	155,000 square miles--about seventy times the size of the state of
15454	Delaware. It could readily be divided into five or six large states, if
15455	that became necessary to preserve the Southern balance of power.
15456	
15457	_Early American Relations with California._--Time and tide, it seems,
15458	were not on the side of the planters. Already Americans of a far
15459	different type were invading the Pacific slope. Long before Polk ever
15460	dreamed of California, the Yankee with his cargo of notions had been
15461	around the Horn. Daring skippers had sailed out of New England harbors
15462	with a variety of goods, bent their course around South America to
15463	California, on to China and around the world, trading as they went and
15464	leaving pots, pans, woolen cloth, guns, boots, shoes, salt fish, naval
15465	stores, and rum in their wake. "Home from Californy!" rang the cry in
15466	many a New England port as a good captain let go his anchor on his
15467	return from the long trading voyage in the Pacific.
15468	
15469	[Illustration: THE OVERLAND TRAILS]
15470	
15471	_The Overland Trails._--Not to be outdone by the mariners of the deep,
15472	western scouts searched for overland routes to the Pacific. Zebulon
15473	Pike, explorer and pathfinder, by his expedition into the Southwest
15474	during Jefferson's administration, had discovered the resources of New
15475	Spain and had shown his countrymen how easy it was to reach Santa Fe
15476	from the upper waters of the Arkansas River. Not long afterward, traders
15477	laid open the route, making Franklin, Missouri, and later Fort
15478	Leavenworth the starting point. Along the trail, once surveyed, poured
15479	caravans heavily guarded by armed men against marauding Indians. Sand
15480	storms often wiped out all signs of the route; hunger and thirst did
15481	many a band of wagoners to death; but the lure of the game and the
15482	profits at the end kept the business thriving. Huge stocks of cottons,
15483	glass, hardware, and ammunition were drawn almost across the continent
15484	to be exchanged at Santa Fe for furs, Indian blankets, silver, and
15485	mules; and many a fortune was made out of the traffic.
15486	
15487	_Americans in California._--Why stop at Santa Fe? The question did not
15488	long remain unanswered. In 1829, Ewing Young broke the path to Los
15489	Angeles. Thirteen years later Fremont made the first of his celebrated
15490	expeditions across plain, desert, and mountain, arousing the interest of
15491	the entire country in the Far West. In the wake of the pathfinders went
15492	adventurers, settlers, and artisans. By 1847, more than one-fifth of the
15493	inhabitants in the little post of two thousand on San Francisco Bay were
15494	from the United States. The Mexican War, therefore, was not the
15495	beginning but the end of the American conquest of California--a conquest
15496	initiated by Americans who went to till the soil, to trade, or to follow
15497	some mechanical pursuit.
15498	
15499	_The Discovery of Gold._--As if to clinch the hold on California already
15500	secured by the friends of free soil, there came in 1848 the sudden
15501	discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in the Sacramento Valley. When this
15502	exciting news reached the East, a mighty rush began to California, over
15503	the trails, across the Isthmus of Panama, and around Cape Horn. Before
15504	two years had passed, it is estimated that a hundred thousand people, in
15505	search of fortunes, had arrived in California--mechanics, teachers,
15506	doctors, lawyers, farmers, miners, and laborers from the four corners of
15507	the earth.
15508

15511	SAN FRANCISCO IN 1849]
15512	
15513	_California a Free State._--With this increase in population there
15514	naturally resulted the usual demand for admission to the union. Instead
15515	of waiting for authority from Washington, the Californians held a
15516	convention in 1849 and framed their constitution. With impatience, the
15517	delegates brushed aside the plea that "the balance of power between the
15518	North and South" required the admission of their state as a slave
15519	commonwealth. Without a dissenting voice, they voted in favor of freedom
15520	and boldly made their request for inclusion among the United States.
15521	President Taylor, though a Southern man, advised Congress to admit the
15522	applicant. Robert Toombs of Georgia vowed to God that he preferred
15523	secession. Henry Clay, the great compromiser, came to the rescue and in
15524	1850 California was admitted as a free state.
15525	
15526	=Utah.=--On the long road to California, in the midst of forbidding and
15527	barren wastes, a religious sect, the Mormons, had planted a colony
15528	destined to a stormy career. Founded in 1830 under the leadership of
15529	Joseph Smith of New York, the sect had suffered from many cruel buffets
15530	of fortune. From Ohio they had migrated into Missouri where they were
15531	set upon and beaten. Some of them were murdered by indignant neighbors.
15532	Harried out of Missouri, they went into Illinois only to see their
15533	director and prophet, Smith, first imprisoned by the authorities and
15534	then shot by a mob. Having raised up a cloud of enemies on account of
15535	both their religious faith and their practice of allowing a man to have
15536	more than one wife, they fell in heartily with the suggestion of a new
15537	leader, Brigham Young, that they go into the Far West beyond the plains
15538	of Kansas--into the forlorn desert where the wicked would cease from
15539	troubling and the weary could be at rest, as they read in the Bible. In
15540	1847, Young, with a company of picked men, searched far and wide until
15541	he found a suitable spot overlooking the Salt Lake Valley. Returning to
15542	Illinois, he gathered up his followers, now numbering several thousand,
15543	and in one mighty wagon caravan they all went to their distant haven.
15544	
15545	_Brigham Young and His Economic System._--In Brigham Young the Mormons
15546	had a leader of remarkable power who gave direction to the redemption of
15547	the arid soil, the management of property, and the upbuilding of
15548	industry. He promised them to make the desert blossom as the rose, and
15549	verily he did it. He firmly shaped the enterprise of the colony along
15550	co-operative lines, holding down the speculator and profiteer with one
15551	hand and giving encouragement to the industrious poor with the other.
15552	With the shrewdness befitting a good business man, he knew how to draw
15553	the line between public and private interest. Land was given outright to
15554	each family, but great care was exercised in the distribution so that
15555	none should have great advantage over another. The purchase of supplies
15556	and the sale of produce were carried on through a cooperative store, the
15557	profits of which went to the common good. Encountering for the first
15558	time in the history of the Anglo-Saxon race the problem of aridity, the
15559	Mormons surmounted the most perplexing obstacles with astounding skill.
15560	They built irrigation works by cooperative labor and granted water
15561	rights to all families on equitable terms.
15562	
15563	_The Growth of Industries._--Though farming long remained the major
15564	interest of the colony, the Mormons, eager to be self-supporting in
15565	every possible way, bent their efforts also to manufacturing and later
15566	to mining. Their missionaries, who hunted in the highways and byways of
15567	Europe for converts, never failed to stress the economic advantages of
15568	the sect. "We want," proclaimed President Young to all the earth, "a
15569	company of woolen manufacturers to come with machinery and take the wool
15570	from the sheep and convert it into the best clothes. We want a company
15571	of potters; we need them; the clay is ready and the dishes wanted.... We
15572	want some men to start a furnace forthwith; the iron, coal, and molders
15573	are waiting.... We have a printing press and any one who can take good
15574	printing and writing paper to the Valley will be a blessing to
15575	themselves and the church." Roads and bridges were built; millions were
15576	spent in experiments in agriculture and manufacturing; missionaries at a
15577	huge cost were maintained in the East and in Europe; an army was kept
15578	for defense against the Indians; and colonies were planted in the
15579	outlying regions. A historian of Deseret, as the colony was called by
15580	the Mormons, estimated in 1895 that by the labor of their hands the
15581	people had produced nearly half a billion dollars in wealth since the
15582	coming of the vanguard.
15583	
15584	_Polygamy Forbidden._--The hope of the Mormons that they might forever
15585	remain undisturbed by outsiders was soon dashed to earth, for hundreds
15586	of farmers and artisans belonging to other religious sects came to
15587	settle among them. In 1850 the colony was so populous and prosperous
15588	that it was organized into a territory of the United States and brought
15589	under the supervision of the federal government. Protests against
15590	polygamy were raised in the colony and at the seat of authority three
15591	thousand miles away at Washington. The new Republican party in 1856
15592	proclaimed it "the right and duty of Congress to prohibit in the
15593	Territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery." In
15594	due time the Mormons had to give up their marriage practices which were
15595	condemned by the common opinion of all western civilization; but they
15596	kept their religious faith. Monuments to their early enterprise are seen
15597	in the Temple and the Tabernacle, the irrigation works, and the great
15598	wealth of the Church.
15599	
15600	
15601	SUMMARY OF WESTERN DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL POLITICS
15602	
15603	While the statesmen of the old generation were solving the problems of
15604	their age, hunters, pioneers, and home seekers were preparing new
15605	problems beyond the Alleghanies. The West was rising in population and
15606	wealth. Between 1783 and 1829, eleven states were added to the original
15607	thirteen. All but two were in the West. Two of them were in the
15608	Louisiana territory beyond the Mississippi. Here the process of
15609	colonization was repeated. Hardy frontier people cut down the forests,
15610	built log cabins, laid out farms, and cut roads through the wilderness.
15611	They began a new civilization just as the immigrants to Virginia or
15612	Massachusetts had done two centuries earlier.
15613	
15614	Like the seaboard colonists before them, they too cherished the spirit
15615	of independence and power. They had not gone far upon their course
15616	before they resented the monopoly of the presidency by the East. In 1829
15617	they actually sent one of their own cherished leaders, Andrew Jackson,
15618	to the White House. Again in 1840, in 1844, in 1848, and in 1860, the
15619	Mississippi Valley could boast that one of its sons had been chosen for
15620	the seat of power at Washington. Its democratic temper evoked a cordial
15621	response in the towns of the East where the old aristocracy had been put
15622	aside and artisans had been given the ballot.
15623	
15624	For three decades the West occupied the interest of the nation. Under
15625	Jackson's leadership, it destroyed the second United States Bank. When
15626	he smote nullification in South Carolina, it gave him cordial support.
15627	It approved his policy of parceling out government offices among party
15628	workers--"the spoils system" in all its fullness. On only one point did
15629	it really dissent. The West heartily favored internal improvements, the
15630	appropriation of federal funds for highways, canals, and railways.
15631	Jackson had misgivings on this question and awakened sharp criticism by
15632	vetoing a road improvement bill.
15633	
15634	From their point of vantage on the frontier, the pioneers pressed on
15635	westward. They pushed into Texas, created a state, declared their
15636	independence, demanded a place in the union, and precipitated a war with
15637	Mexico. They crossed the trackless plain and desert, laying out trails
15638	to Santa Fe, to Oregon, and to California. They were upon the scene when
15639	the Mexican War brought California under the Stars and Stripes. They had
15640	laid out their farms in the Willamette Valley when the slogan
15641	"Fifty-Four Forty or Fight" forced a settlement of the Oregon boundary.
15642	California and Oregon were already in the union when there arose the
15643	Great Civil War testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived
15644	and so dedicated could long endure.

15733	CHAPTER XIII
15734	
15735	THE RISE OF THE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM
15736	
15737	
15738	If Jefferson could have lived to see the Stars and Stripes planted on
15739	the Pacific Coast, the broad empire of Texas added to the planting
15740	states, and the valley of the Willamette waving with wheat sown by
15741	farmers from New England, he would have been more than fortified in his
15742	faith that the future of America lay in agriculture. Even a stanch old
15743	Federalist like Gouverneur Morris or Josiah Quincy would have mournfully
15744	conceded both the prophecy and the claim. Manifest destiny never seemed
15745	more clearly written in the stars.
15746	
15747	As the farmers from the Northwest and planters from the Southwest poured
15748	in upon the floor of Congress, the party of Jefferson, christened anew
15749	by Jackson, grew stronger year by year. Opponents there were, no doubt,
15750	disgruntled critics and Whigs by conviction; but in 1852 Franklin
15751	Pierce, the Democratic candidate for President, carried every state in
15752	the union except Massachusetts, Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee. This
15753	victory, a triumph under ordinary circumstances, was all the more
15754	significant in that Pierce was pitted against a hero of the Mexican War,
15755	General Scott, whom the Whigs, hoping to win by rousing the martial
15756	ardor of the voters, had nominated. On looking at the election returns,
15757	the new President calmly assured the planters that "the general
15758	principle of reduction of duties with a view to revenue may now be
15759	regarded as the settled policy of the country." With equal confidence,
15760	he waved aside those agitators who devoted themselves "to the supposed
15761	interests of the relatively few Africans in the United States." Like a
15762	watchman in the night he called to the country: "All's well."
15763	
15764	The party of Hamilton and Clay lay in the dust.
15765	
15766	
15767	THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
15768	
15769	As pride often goeth before a fall, so sanguine expectation is sometimes
15770	the symbol of defeat. Jackson destroyed the bank. Polk signed the tariff
15771	bill of 1846 striking an effective blow at the principle of protection
15772	for manufactures. Pierce promised to silence the abolitionists. His
15773	successor was to approve a drastic step in the direction of free trade.
15774	Nevertheless all these things left untouched the springs of power that
15775	were in due time to make America the greatest industrial nation on the
15776	earth; namely, vast national resources, business enterprise, inventive
15777	genius, and the free labor supply of Europe. Unseen by the thoughtless,
15778	unrecorded in the diaries of wiseacres, rarely mentioned in the speeches
15779	of statesmen, there was swiftly rising such a tide in the affairs of
15780	America as Jefferson and Hamilton never dreamed of in their little
15781	philosophies.
15782	
15783	=The Inventors.=--Watt and Boulton experimenting with steam in England,
15784	Whitney combining wood and steel into a cotton gin, Fulton and Fitch
15785	applying the steam engine to navigation, Stevens and Peter Cooper trying
15786	out the "iron horse" on "iron highways," Slater building spinning mills
15787	in Pawtucket, Howe attaching the needle to the flying wheel, Morse
15788	spanning a continent with the telegraph, Cyrus Field linking the markets
15789	of the new world with the old along the bed of the Atlantic, McCormick
15790	breaking the sickle under the reaper--these men and a thousand more were
15791	destroying in a mighty revolution of industry the world of the
15792	stagecoach and the tallow candle which Washington and Franklin had
15793	inherited little changed from the age of Caesar. Whitney was to make
15794	cotton king. Watt and Fulton were to make steel and steam masters of the
15795	world. Agriculture was to fall behind in the race for supremacy.
15796	
15797	=Industry Outstrips Planting.=--The story of invention, that tribute to
15798	the triumph of mind over matter, fascinating as a romance, need not be
15799	treated in detail here. The effects of invention on social and political
15800	life, multitudinous and never-ending, form the very warp and woof of
15801	American progress from the days of Andrew Jackson to the latest hour.
15802	Neither the great civil conflict--the clash of two systems--nor the
15803	problems of the modern age can be approached without an understanding of
15804	the striking phases of industrialism.
15805	
15806	[Illustration: A NEW ENGLAND MILL BUILT IN 1793]
15807	
15808	First and foremost among them was the uprush of mills managed by
15809	captains of industry and manned by labor drawn from farms, cities, and
15810	foreign lands. For every planter who cleared a domain in the Southwest
15811	and gathered his army of bondmen about him, there rose in the North a
15812	magician of steam and steel who collected under his roof an army of free
15813	workers.
15814	
15815	In seven league boots this new giant strode ahead of the Southern giant.
15816	Between 1850 and 1859, to use dollars and cents as the measure of
15817	progress, the value of domestic manufactures including mines and
15818	fisheries rose from $1,019,106,616 to $1,900,000,000, an increase of
15819	eighty-six per cent in ten years. In this same period the total
15820	production of naval stores, rice, sugar, tobacco, and cotton, the
15821	staples of the South, went only from $165,000,000, in round figures, to
15822	$204,000,000. At the halfway point of the century, the capital invested
15823	in industry, commerce, and cities far exceeded the value of all the farm
15824	land between the Atlantic and the Pacific; thus the course of economy
15825	had been reversed in fifty years. Tested by figures of production, King
15826	Cotton had shriveled by 1860 to a petty prince in comparison, for each
15827	year the captains of industry turned out goods worth nearly twenty times
15828	all the bales of cotton picked on Southern plantations. Iron, boots and
15829	shoes, and leather goods pouring from Northern mills surpassed in value
15830	the entire cotton output.
15831	
15832	=The Agrarian West Turns to Industry.=--Nor was this vast enterprise
15833	confined to the old Northeast where, as Madison had sagely remarked,
15834	commerce was early dominant. "Cincinnati," runs an official report in
15835	1854, "appears to be a great central depot for ready-made clothing and
15836	its manufacture for the Western markets may be said to be one of the
15837	great trades of that city." There, wrote another traveler, "I heard the
15838	crack of the cattle driver's whip and the hum of the factory: the West
15839	and the East meeting." Louisville and St. Louis were already famous for
15840	their clothing trades and the manufacture of cotton bagging. Five
15841	hundred of the two thousand woolen mills in the country in 1860 were in
15842	the Western states. Of the output of flour and grist mills, which almost
15843	reached in value the cotton crop of 1850, the Ohio Valley furnished a
15844	rapidly growing share. The old home of Jacksonian democracy, where
15845	Federalists had been almost as scarce as monarchists, turned slowly
15846	backward, as the needle to the pole, toward the principle of protection
15847	for domestic industry, espoused by Hamilton and defended by Clay.
15848	
15849	=The Extension of Canals and Railways.=--As necessary to mechanical
15850	industry as steel and steam power was the great market, spread over a
15851	wide and diversified area and knit together by efficient means of
15852	transportation. This service was supplied to industry by the steamship,
15853	which began its career on the Hudson in 1807; by the canals, of which
15854	the Erie opened in 1825 was the most noteworthy; and by the railways,
15855	which came into practical operation about 1830.
15856	
15857	[Illustration: _From an old print_
15858	
15859	AN EARLY RAILWAY]
15860	
15861	With sure instinct the Eastern manufacturer reached out for the markets
15862	of the Northwest territory where free farmers were producing annually
15863	staggering crops of corn, wheat, bacon, and wool. The two great canal
15864	systems--the Erie connecting New York City with the waterways of the
15865	Great Lakes and the Pennsylvania chain linking Philadelphia with the
15866	headwaters of the Ohio--gradually turned the tide of trade from New
15867	Orleans to the Eastern seaboard. The railways followed the same paths.
15868	By 1860, New York had rail connections with Chicago and St. Louis, one
15869	of the routes running through the Hudson and Mohawk valleys and along
15870	the Great Lakes, the other through Philadelphia and Pennsylvania and
15871	across the rich wheat fields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Baltimore,
15872	not to be outdone by her two rivals, reached out over the mountains for
15873	the Western trade and in 1857 had trains running into St. Louis.
15874	
15875	In railway enterprise the South took more interest than in canals, and
15876	the friends of that section came to its aid. To offset the magnet
15877	drawing trade away from the Mississippi Valley, lines were built from
15878	the Gulf to Chicago, the Illinois Central part of the project being a
15879	monument to the zeal and industry of a Democrat, better known in
15880	politics than in business, Stephen A. Douglas. The swift movement of
15881	cotton and tobacco to the North or to seaports was of common concern to
15882	planters and manufacturers. Accordingly lines were flung down along the
15883	Southern coast, linking Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah with the
15884	Northern markets. Other lines struck inland from the coast, giving a
15885	rail outlet to the sea for Raleigh, Columbia, Atlanta, Chattanooga,
15886	Nashville, and Montgomery. Nevertheless, in spite of this enterprise,
15887	the mileage of all the Southern states in 1860 did not equal that of
15888	Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois combined.
15889	
15890	=Banking and Finance.=--Out of commerce and manufactures and the
15891	construction and operation of railways came such an accumulation of
15892	capital in the Northern states as merchants of old never imagined. The
15893	banks of the four industrial states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New
15894	York, and Pennsylvania in 1860 had funds greater than the banks in all
15895	the other states combined. New York City had become the money market of
15896	America, the center to which industrial companies, railway promoters,
15897	farmers, and planters turned for capital to initiate and carry on their
15898	operations. The banks of Louisiana, South Carolina, Georgia, and
15899	Virginia, it is true, had capital far in excess of the banks of the
15900	Northwest; but still they were relatively small compared with the
15901	financial institutions of the East.
15902	
15903	=The Growth of the Industrial Population.=--A revolution of such
15904	magnitude in industry, transport, and finance, overturning as it did the
15905	agrarian civilization of the old Northwest and reaching out to the very
15906	borders of the country, could not fail to bring in its train
15907	consequences of a striking character. Some were immediate and obvious.
15908	Others require a fullness of time not yet reached to reveal their
15909	complete significance. Outstanding among them was the growth of an
15910	industrial population, detached from the land, concentrated in cities,
15911	and, to use Jefferson's phrase, dependent upon "the caprices and
15912	casualties of trade" for a livelihood. This was a result, as the great
15913	Virginian had foreseen, which flowed inevitably from public and private
15914	efforts to stimulate industry as against agriculture.
15915	
15916	[Illustration: LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS, IN 1838, AN EARLY INDUSTRIAL
15917	TOWN]
15918	
15919	It was estimated in 1860, on the basis of the census figures, that
15920	mechanical production gave employment to 1,100,000 men and 285,000
15921	women, making, if the average number of dependents upon them be
15922	reckoned, nearly six million people or about one-sixth of the population
15923	of the country sustained from manufactures. "This," runs the official
15924	record, "was exclusive of the number engaged in the production of many
15925	of the raw materials and of the food for manufacturers; in the
15926	distribution of their products, such as merchants, clerks, draymen,
15927	mariners, the employees of railroads, expresses, and steamboats; of
15928	capitalists, various artistic and professional classes, as well as
15929	carpenters, bricklayers, painters, and the members of other mechanical
15930	trades not classed as manufactures. It is safe to assume, then, that
15931	one-third of the whole population is supported, directly, or indirectly,
15932	by manufacturing industry." Taking, however, the number of persons
15933	directly supported by manufactures, namely about six millions, reveals
15934	the astounding fact that the white laboring population, divorced from
15935	the soil, already exceeded the number of slaves on Southern farms and
15936	plantations.
15937	
15938	_Immigration._--The more carefully the rapid growth of the industrial
15939	population is examined, the more surprising is the fact that such an
15940	immense body of free laborers could be found, particularly when it is
15941	recalled to what desperate straits the colonial leaders were put in
15942	securing immigrants,--slavery, indentured servitude, and kidnapping
15943	being the fruits of their necessities. The answer to the enigma is to be
15944	found partly in European conditions and partly in the cheapness of
15945	transportation after the opening of the era of steam navigation. Shrewd
15946	observers of the course of events had long foreseen that a flood of
15947	cheap labor was bound to come when the way was made easy. Some, among
15948	them Chief Justice Ellsworth, went so far as to prophesy that white
15949	labor would in time be so abundant that slavery would disappear as the
15950	more costly of the two labor systems. The processes of nature were aided
15951	by the policies of government in England and Germany.
15952	
15953	_The Coming of the Irish._--The opposition of the Irish people to the
15954	English government, ever furious and irrepressible, was increased in the
15955	mid forties by an almost total failure of the potato crop, the main
15956	support of the peasants. Catholic in religion, they had been compelled
15957	to support a Protestant church. Tillers of the soil by necessity, they
15958	were forced to pay enormous tributes to absentee landlords in England
15959	whose claim to their estates rested upon the title of conquest and
15960	confiscation. Intensely loyal to their race, the Irish were subjected in
15961	all things to the Parliament at London, in which their small minority of
15962	representatives had little influence save in holding a balance of power
15963	between the two contending English parties. To the constant political
15964	irritation, the potato famine added physical distress beyond
15965	description. In cottages and fields and along the highways the victims
15966	of starvation lay dead by the hundreds, the relief which charity
15967	afforded only bringing misery more sharply to the foreground. Those who
15968	were fortunate enough to secure passage money sought escape to America.
15969	In 1844 the total immigration into the United States was less than
15970	eighty thousand; in 1850 it had risen by leaps and bounds to more than
15971	three hundred thousand. Between 1820 and 1860 the immigrants from the
15972	United Kingdom numbered 2,750,000, of whom more than one-half were
15973	Irish. It has been said with a touch of exaggeration that the American
15974	canals and railways of those days were built by the labor of Irishmen.
15975	
15976	_The German Migration._--To political discontent and economic distress,
15977	such as was responsible for the coming of the Irish, may likewise be
15978	traced the source of the Germanic migration. The potato blight that fell
15979	upon Ireland visited the Rhine Valley and Southern Germany at the same
15980	time with results as pitiful, if less extensive. The calamity inflicted
15981	by nature was followed shortly by another inflicted by the despotic
15982	conduct of German kings and princes. In 1848 there had occurred
15983	throughout Europe a popular uprising in behalf of republics and
15984	democratic government. For a time it rode on a full tide of success.
15985	Kings were overthrown, or compelled to promise constitutional
15986	government, and tyrannical ministers fled from their palaces. Then came
15987	reaction. Those who had championed the popular cause were imprisoned,
15988	shot, or driven out of the land. Men of attainments and distinction,
15989	whose sole offense was opposition to the government of kings and
15990	princes, sought an asylum in America, carrying with them to the land of
15991	their adoption the spirit of liberty and democracy. In 1847 over fifty
15992	thousand Germans came to America, the forerunners of a migration that
15993	increased, almost steadily, for many years. The record of 1860 showed
15994	that in the previous twenty years nearly a million and a half had found
15995	homes in the United States. Far and wide they scattered, from the mills
15996	and shops of the seacoast towns to the uttermost frontiers of Wisconsin
15997	and Minnesota.
15998	
15999	_The Labor of Women and Children._--If the industries, canals, and
16000	railways of the country were largely manned by foreign labor, still
16001	important native sources must not be overlooked; above all, the women
16002	and children of the New England textile districts. Spinning and weaving,
16003	by a tradition that runs far beyond the written records of mankind,
16004	belonged to women. Indeed it was the dexterous housewives, spinsters,
16005	and boys and girls that laid the foundations of the textile industry in
16006	America, foundations upon which the mechanical revolution was built. As
16007	the wheel and loom were taken out of the homes to the factories operated
16008	by water power or the steam engine, the women and, to use Hamilton's
16009	phrase, "the children of tender years," followed as a matter of course.
16010	"The cotton manufacture alone employs six thousand persons in Lowell,"
16011	wrote a French observer in 1836; "of this number nearly five thousand
16012	are young women from seventeen to twenty-four years of age, the
16013	daughters of farmers from the different New England states." It was not
16014	until after the middle of the century that foreign lands proved to be
16015	the chief source from which workers were recruited for the factories of
16016	New England. It was then that the daughters of the Puritans, outdone by
16017	the competition of foreign labor, both of men and women, left the
16018	spinning jenny and the loom to other hands.
16019	
16020	=The Rise of Organized Labor.=--The changing conditions of American
16021	life, marked by the spreading mill towns of New England, New York, and
16022	Pennsylvania and the growth of cities like Buffalo, Cincinnati,
16023	Louisville, St. Louis, Detroit, and Chicago in the West, naturally
16024	brought changes, as Jefferson had prophesied, in "manners and morals." A
16025	few mechanics, smiths, carpenters, and masons, widely scattered through
16026	farming regions and rural villages, raise no such problems as tens of
16027	thousands of workers collected in one center in daily intercourse,
16028	learning the power of cooperation and union.
16029	
16030	Even before the coming of steam and machinery, in the "good old days" of
16031	handicrafts, laborers in many trades--printers, shoemakers, carpenters,
16032	for example--had begun to draw together in the towns for the advancement
16033	of their interests in the form of higher wages, shorter days, and
16034	milder laws. The shoemakers of Philadelphia, organized in 1794,
16035	conducted a strike in 1799 and held together until indicted seven years
16036	later for conspiracy. During the twenties and thirties, local labor
16037	unions sprang up in all industrial centers and they led almost
16038	immediately to city federations of the several crafts.
16039	
16040	As the thousands who were dependent upon their daily labor for their
16041	livelihood mounted into the millions and industries spread across the
16042	continent, the local unions of craftsmen grew into national craft
16043	organizations bound together by the newspapers, the telegraph, and the
16044	railways. Before 1860 there were several such national trade unions,
16045	including the plumbers, printers, mule spinners, iron molders, and stone
16046	cutters. All over the North labor leaders arose--men unknown to general
16047	history but forceful and resourceful characters who forged links binding
16048	scattered and individual workers into a common brotherhood. An attempt
16049	was even made in 1834 to federate all the crafts into a permanent
16050	national organization; but it perished within three years through lack
16051	of support. Half a century had to elapse before the American Federation
16052	of Labor was to accomplish this task.
16053	
16054	All the manifestations of the modern labor movement had appeared, in
16055	germ at least, by the time the mid-century was reached: unions, labor
16056	leaders, strikes, a labor press, a labor political program, and a labor
16057	political party. In every great city industrial disputes were a common
16058	occurrence. The papers recorded about four hundred in two years,
16059	1853-54, local affairs but forecasting economic struggles in a larger
16060	field. The labor press seems to have begun with the founding of the
16061	_Mechanics' Free Press_ in Philadelphia in 1828 and the establishment of
16062	the New York _Workingman's Advocate_ shortly afterward. These
16063	semi-political papers were in later years followed by regular trade
16064	papers designed to weld together and advance the interests of particular
16065	crafts. Edited by able leaders, these little sheets with limited
16066	circulation wielded an enormous influence in the ranks of the workers.
16067	
16068	=Labor and Politics.=--As for the political program of labor, the main
16069	planks were clear and specific: the abolition of imprisonment for debt,
16070	manhood suffrage in states where property qualifications still
16071	prevailed, free and universal education, laws protecting the safety and
16072	health of workers in mills and factories, abolition of lotteries, repeal
16073	of laws requiring militia service, and free land in the West.
16074	
16075	Into the labor papers and platforms there sometimes crept a note of
16076	hostility to the masters of industry, a sign of bitterness that excited
16077	little alarm while cheap land in the West was open to the discontented.
16078	The Philadelphia workmen, in issuing a call for a local convention,
16079	invited "all those of our fellow citizens who live by their own labor
16080	and none other." In Newcastle county, Delaware, the association of
16081	working people complained in 1830: "The poor have no laws; the laws are
16082	made by the rich and of course for the rich." Here and there an
16083	extremist went to the length of advocating an equal division of wealth
16084	among all the people--the crudest kind of communism.
16085	
16086	Agitation of this character produced in labor circles profound distrust
16087	of both Whigs and Democrats who talked principally about tariffs and
16088	banks; it resulted in attempts to found independent labor parties. In
16089	Philadelphia, Albany, New York City, and New England, labor candidates
16090	were put up for elections in the early thirties and in a few cases were
16091	victorious at the polls. "The balance of power has at length got into
16092	the hands of the working people, where it properly belongs,"
16093	triumphantly exclaimed the _Mechanics' Free Press_ of Philadelphia in
16094	1829. But the triumph was illusory. Dissensions appeared in the labor
16095	ranks. The old party leaders, particularly of Tammany Hall, the
16096	Democratic party organization in New York City, offered concessions to
16097	labor in return for votes. Newspapers unsparingly denounced "trade union
16098	politicians" as "demagogues," "levellers," and "rag, tag, and bobtail";
16099	and some of them, deeming labor unrest the sour fruit of manhood
16100	suffrage, suggested disfranchisement as a remedy. Under the influence
16101	of concessions and attacks the political fever quickly died away, and
16102	the end of the decade left no remnant of the labor political parties.
16103	Labor leaders turned to a task which seemed more substantial and
16104	practical, that of organizing workingmen into craft unions for the
16105	definite purpose of raising wages and reducing hours.
16106	
16107	
16108	THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND NATIONAL POLITICS
16109	
16110	=Southern Plans for Union with the West.=--It was long the design of
16111	Southern statesmen like Calhoun to hold the West and the South together
16112	in one political party. The theory on which they based their hope was
16113	simple. Both sections were agricultural--the producers of raw materials
16114	and the buyers of manufactured goods. The planters were heavy purchasers
16115	of Western bacon, pork, mules, and grain. The Mississippi River and its
16116	tributaries formed the natural channel for the transportation of heavy
16117	produce southward to the plantations and outward to Europe. Therefore,
16118	ran their political reasoning, the interests of the two sections were
16119	one. By standing together in favor of low tariffs, they could buy their
16120	manufactures cheaply in Europe and pay for them in cotton, tobacco, and
16121	grain. The union of the two sections under Jackson's management seemed
16122	perfect.
16123	
16124	=The East Forms Ties with the West.=--Eastern leaders were not blind to
16125	the ambitions of Southern statesmen. On the contrary, they also
16126	recognized the importance of forming strong ties with the agrarian West
16127	and drawing the produce of the Ohio Valley to Philadelphia and New York.
16128	The canals and railways were the physical signs of this economic union,
16129	and the results, commercial and political, were soon evident. By the
16130	middle of the century, Southern economists noted the change, one of
16131	them, De Bow, lamenting that "the great cities of the North have
16132	severally penetrated the interior with artificial lines until they have
16133	taken from the open and untaxed current of the Mississippi the commerce
16134	produced on its borders." To this writer it was an astounding thing to
16135	behold "the number of steamers that now descend the upper Mississippi
16136	River, loaded to the guards with produce, as far as the mouth of the
16137	Illinois River and then turn up that stream with their cargoes to be
16138	shipped to New York _via_ Chicago. The Illinois canal has not only swept
16139	the whole produce along the line of the Illinois River to the East, but
16140	it is drawing the products of the upper Mississippi through the same
16141	channel; thus depriving New Orleans and St. Louis of a rich portion of
16142	their former trade."
16143	
16144	If to any shippers the broad current of the great river sweeping down to
16145	New Orleans offered easier means of physical communication to the sea
16146	than the canals and railways, the difference could be overcome by the
16147	credit which Eastern bankers were able to extend to the grain and
16148	produce buyers, in the first instance, and through them to the farmers
16149	on the soil. The acute Southern observer just quoted, De Bow, admitted
16150	with evident regret, in 1852, that "last autumn, the rich regions of
16151	Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were flooded with the local bank notes of
16152	the Eastern States, advanced by the New York houses on produce to be
16153	shipped by way of the canals in the spring.... These moneyed facilities
16154	enable the packer, miller, and speculator to hold on to their produce
16155	until the opening of navigation in the spring and they are no longer
16156	obliged, as formerly, to hurry off their shipments during the winter by
16157	the way of New Orleans in order to realize funds by drafts on their
16158	shipments. The banking facilities at the East are doing as much to draw
16159	trade from us as the canals and railways which Eastern capital is
16160	constructing." Thus canals, railways, and financial credit were swiftly
16161	forging bonds of union between the old home of Jacksonian Democracy in
16162	the West and the older home of Federalism in the East. The nationalism
16163	to which Webster paid eloquent tribute became more and more real with
16164	the passing of time. The self-sufficiency of the pioneer was broken down
16165	as he began to watch the produce markets of New York and Philadelphia
16166	where the prices of corn and hogs fixed his earnings for the year.
16167	
16168	=The West and Manufactures.=--In addition to the commercial bonds
16169	between the East and the West there was growing up a common interest in
16170	manufactures. As skilled white labor increased in the Ohio Valley, the
16171	industries springing up in the new cities made Western life more like
16172	that of the industrial East than like that of the planting South.
16173	Moreover, the Western states produced some important raw materials for
16174	American factories, which called for protection against foreign
16175	competition, notably, wool, hemp, and flax. As the South had little or
16176	no foreign competition in cotton and tobacco, the East could not offer
16177	protection for her raw materials in exchange for protection for
16178	industries. With the West, however, it became possible to establish
16179	reciprocity in tariffs; that is, for example, to trade a high rate on
16180	wool for a high rate on textiles or iron.
16181	
16182	=The South Dependent on the North.=--While East and West were drawing
16183	together, the distinctions between North and South were becoming more
16184	marked; the latter, having few industries and producing little save raw
16185	materials, was being forced into the position of a dependent section. As
16186	a result of the protective tariff, Southern planters were compelled to
16187	turn more and more to Northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes,
16188	plows, and machinery. Nearly all the goods which they bought in Europe
16189	in exchange for their produce came overseas to Northern ports, whence
16190	transshipments were made by rail and water to Southern points of
16191	distribution. Their rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were
16192	not carried to Europe in British bottoms, were transported by Northern
16193	masters. In these ways, a large part of the financial operations
16194	connected with the sale of Southern produce and the purchase of goods in
16195	exchange passed into the hands of Northern merchants and bankers who,
16196	naturally, made profits from their transactions. Finally, Southern
16197	planters who wanted to buy more land and more slaves on credit borrowed
16198	heavily in the North where huge accumulations made the rates of interest
16199	lower than the smaller banks of the South could afford.
16200	
16201	=The South Reckons the Cost of Economic Dependence.=--As Southern
16202	dependence upon Northern capital became more and more marked, Southern
16203	leaders began to chafe at what they regarded as restraints laid upon
16204	their enterprise. In a word, they came to look upon the planter as a
16205	tribute-bearer to the manufacturer and financier. "The South,"
16206	expostulated De Bow, "stands in the attitude of feeding ... a vast
16207	population of [Northern] merchants, shipowners, capitalists, and others
16208	who, without claims on her progeny, drink up the life blood of her
16209	trade.... Where goes the value of our labor but to those who, taking
16210	advantage of our folly, ship for us, buy for us, sell to us, and, after
16211	turning our own capital to their profitable account, return laden with
16212	our money to enjoy their easily earned opulence at home."
16213	
16214	Southern statisticians, not satisfied with generalities, attempted to
16215	figure out how great was this tribute in dollars and cents. They
16216	estimated that the planters annually lent to Northern merchants the full
16217	value of their exports, a hundred millions or more, "to be used in the
16218	manipulation of foreign imports." They calculated that no less than
16219	forty millions all told had been paid to shipowners in profits. They
16220	reckoned that, if the South were to work up her own cotton, she would
16221	realize from seventy to one hundred millions a year that otherwise went
16222	North. Finally, to cap the climax, they regretted that planters spent
16223	some fifteen millions a year pleasure-seeking in the alluring cities and
16224	summer resorts of the North.
16225	
16226	=Southern Opposition to Northern Policies.=--Proceeding from these
16227	premises, Southern leaders drew the logical conclusion that the entire
16228	program of economic measures demanded in the North was without exception
16229	adverse to Southern interests and, by a similar chain of reasoning,
16230	injurious to the corn and wheat producers of the West. Cheap labor
16231	afforded by free immigration, a protective tariff raising prices of
16232	manufactures for the tiller of the soil, ship subsidies increasing the
16233	tonnage of carrying trade in Northern hands, internal improvements
16234	forging new economic bonds between the East and the West, a national
16235	banking system giving strict national control over the currency as a
16236	safeguard against paper inflation--all these devices were regarded in
16237	the South as contrary to the planting interest. They were constantly
16238	compared with the restrictive measures by which Great Britain more than
16239	half a century before had sought to bind American interests.
16240	
16241	As oppression justified a war for independence once, statesmen argued,
16242	so it can justify it again. "It is curious as it is melancholy and
16243	distressing," came a broad hint from South Carolina, "to see how
16244	striking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which the
16245	manufacturing states have reduced the planting states and that which
16246	formerly bound the Anglo-American colonies to the British empire....
16247	England said to her American colonies: 'You shall not trade with the
16248	rest of the world for such manufactures as are produced in the mother
16249	country.' The manufacturing states say to their Southern colonies: 'You
16250	shall not trade with the rest of the world for such manufactures as we
16251	produce.'" The conclusion was inexorable: either the South must control
16252	the national government and its economic measures, or it must declare,
16253	as America had done four score years before, its political and economic
16254	independence. As Northern mills multiplied, as railways spun their
16255	mighty web over the face of the North, and as accumulated capital rose
16256	into the hundreds of millions, the conviction of the planters and their
16257	statesmen deepened into desperation.
16258	
16259	=Efforts to Start Southern Industries Fail.=--A few of them, seeing the
16260	predominance of the North, made determined efforts to introduce
16261	manufactures into the South. To the leaders who were averse to secession
16262	and nullification this seemed the only remedy for the growing disparity
16263	in the power of the two sections. Societies for the encouragement of
16264	mechanical industries were formed, the investment of capital was sought,
16265	and indeed a few mills were built on Southern soil. The results were
16266	meager. The natural resources, coal and water power, were abundant; but
16267	the enterprise for direction and the skilled labor were wanting. The
16268	stream of European immigration flowed North and West, not South. The
16269	Irish or German laborer, even if he finally made his home in a city, had
16270	before him, while in the North, the alternative of a homestead on
16271	Western land. To him slavery was a strange, if not a repelling,
16272	institution. He did not take to it kindly nor care to fix his home where
16273	it flourished. While slavery lasted, the economy of the South was
16274	inevitably agricultural. While agriculture predominated, leadership with
16275	equal necessity fell to the planting interest. While the planting
16276	interest ruled, political opposition to Northern economy was destined to
16277	grow in strength.
16278	
16279	=The Southern Theory of Sectionalism.=--In the opinion of the statesmen
16280	who frankly represented the planting interest, the industrial system was
16281	its deadly enemy. Their entire philosophy of American politics was
16282	summed up in a single paragraph by McDuffie, a spokesman for South
16283	Carolina: "Owing to the federative character of our government, the
16284	great geographical extent of our territory, and the diversity of the
16285	pursuits of our citizens in different parts of the union, it has so
16286	happened that two great interests have sprung up, standing directly
16287	opposed to each other. One of these consists of those manufactures which
16288	the Northern and Middle states are capable of producing but which, owing
16289	to the high price of labor and the high profits of capital in those
16290	states, cannot hold competition with foreign manufactures without the
16291	aid of bounties, directly or indirectly given, either by the general
16292	government or by the state governments. The other of these interests
16293	consists of the great agricultural staples of the Southern states which
16294	can find a market only in foreign countries and which can be
16295	advantageously sold only in exchange for foreign manufactures which come
16296	in competition with those of the Northern and Middle states.... These
16297	interests then stand diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to each
16298	other. The interest, the pecuniary interest of the Northern
16299	manufacturer, is directly promoted by every increase of the taxes
16300	imposed upon Southern commerce; and it is unnecessary to add that the
16301	interest of the Southern planter is promoted by every diminution of
16302	taxes imposed upon the productions of their industry. If, under these
16303	circumstances, the manufacturers were clothed with the power of imposing
16304	taxes, at their pleasure, upon the foreign imports of the planter, no
16305	doubt would exist in the mind of any man that it would have all the
16306	characteristics of an absolute and unqualified despotism." The economic
16307	soundness of this reasoning, a subject of interesting speculation for
16308	the economist, is of little concern to the historian. The historical
16309	point is that this opinion was widely held in the South and with the
16310	progress of time became the prevailing doctrine of the planting
16311	statesmen.
16312	
16313	Their antagonism was deepened because they also became convinced, on
16314	what grounds it is not necessary to inquire, that the leaders of the
16315	industrial interest thus opposed to planting formed a consolidated
16316	"aristocracy of wealth," bent upon the pursuit and attainment of
16317	political power at Washington. "By the aid of various associated
16318	interests," continued McDuffie, "the manufacturing capitalists have
16319	obtained a complete and permanent control over the legislation of
16320	Congress on this subject [the tariff].... Men confederated together upon
16321	selfish and interested principles, whether in pursuit of the offices or
16322	the bounties of the government, are ever more active and vigilant than
16323	the great majority who act from disinterested and patriotic impulses.
16324	Have we not witnessed it on this floor, sir? Who ever knew the tariff
16325	men to divide on any question affecting their confederated interests?...
16326	The watchword is, stick together, right or wrong upon every question
16327	affecting the common cause. Such, sir, is the concert and vigilance and
16328	such the combinations by which the manufacturing party, acting upon the
16329	interests of some and the prejudices of others, have obtained a decided
16330	and permanent control over public opinion in all the tariff states."
16331	Thus, as the Southern statesman would have it, the North, in matters
16332	affecting national policies, was ruled by a "confederated interest"
16333	which menaced the planting interest. As the former grew in magnitude and
16334	attached to itself the free farmers of the West through channels of
16335	trade and credit, it followed as night the day that in time the planters
16336	would be overshadowed and at length overborne in the struggle of giants.
16337	Whether the theory was sound or not, Southern statesmen believed it and
16338	acted upon it.

16417	CHAPTER XIV
16418	
16419	THE PLANTING SYSTEM AND NATIONAL POLITICS
16420	
16421	
16422	James Madison, the father of the federal Constitution, after he had
16423	watched for many days the battle royal in the national convention of
16424	1787, exclaimed that the contest was not between the large and the small
16425	states, but between the commercial North and the planting South. From
16426	the inauguration of Washington to the election of Lincoln the sectional
16427	conflict, discerned by this penetrating thinker, exercised a profound
16428	influence on the course of American politics. It was latent during the
16429	"era of good feeling" when the Jeffersonian Republicans adopted
16430	Federalist policies; it flamed up in the contest between the Democrats
16431	and Whigs. Finally it raged in the angry political quarrel which
16432	culminated in the Civil War.
16433	
16434	
16435	SLAVERY--NORTH AND SOUTH
16436	
16437	=The Decline of Slavery in the North.=--At the time of the adoption of
16438	the Constitution, slavery was lawful in all the Northern states except
16439	Massachusetts. There were almost as many bondmen in New York as in
16440	Georgia. New Jersey had more than Delaware or Tennessee, indeed nearly
16441	as many as both combined. All told, however, there were only about forty
16442	thousand in the North as against nearly seven hundred thousand in the
16443	South. Moreover, most of the Northern slaves were domestic servants, not
16444	laborers necessary to keep mills going or fields under cultivation.
16445	
16446	There was, in the North, a steadily growing moral sentiment against the
16447	system. Massachusetts abandoned it in 1780. In the same year,
16448	Pennsylvania provided for gradual emancipation. New Hampshire, where
16449	there had been only a handful, Connecticut with a few thousand
16450	domestics, and New Jersey early followed these examples. New York, in
16451	1799, declared that all children born of slaves after July 4 of that
16452	year should be free, though held for a term as apprentices; and in 1827
16453	it swept away the last vestiges of slavery. So with the passing of the
16454	generation that had framed the Constitution, chattel servitude
16455	disappeared in the commercial states, leaving behind only such
16456	discriminations as disfranchisement or high property qualifications on
16457	colored voters.
16458	
16459	=The Growth of Northern Sentiment against Slavery.=--In both sections of
16460	the country there early existed, among those more or less
16461	philosophically inclined, a strong opposition to slavery on moral as
16462	well as economic grounds. In the constitutional convention of 1787,
16463	Gouverneur Morris had vigorously condemned it and proposed that the
16464	whole country should bear the cost of abolishing it. About the same time
16465	a society for promoting the abolition of slavery, under the presidency
16466	of Benjamin Franklin, laid before Congress a petition that serious
16467	attention be given to the emancipation of "those unhappy men who alone
16468	in this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage." When
16469	Congress, acting on the recommendations of President Jefferson, provided
16470	for the abolition of the foreign slave trade on January 1, 1808, several
16471	Northern members joined with Southern members in condemning the system
16472	as well as the trade. Later, colonization societies were formed to
16473	encourage the emancipation of slaves and their return to Africa. James
16474	Madison was president and Henry Clay vice president of such an
16475	organization.
16476	
16477	The anti-slavery sentiment of which these were the signs was
16478	nevertheless confined to narrow circles and bore no trace of bitterness.
16479	
16480	"We consider slavery your calamity, not your crime," wrote a
16481	distinguished Boston clergyman to his Southern brethren, "and we will
16482	share with you the burden of putting an end to it. We will consent that
16483	the public lands shall be appropriated to this object.... I deprecate
16484	everything which sows discord and exasperating sectional animosities."
16485	
16486	=Uncompromising Abolition.=--In a little while the spirit of generosity
16487	was gone. Just as Jacksonian Democracy rose to power there appeared a
16488	new kind of anti-slavery doctrine--the dogmatism of the abolition
16489	agitator. For mild speculation on the evils of the system was
16490	substituted an imperious and belligerent demand for instant
16491	emancipation. If a date must be fixed for its appearance, the year 1831
16492	may be taken when William Lloyd Garrison founded in Boston his
16493	anti-slavery paper, _The Liberator_. With singleness of purpose and
16494	utter contempt for all opposing opinions and arguments, he pursued his
16495	course of passionate denunciation. He apologized for having ever
16496	"assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition."
16497	He chose for his motto: "Immediate and unconditional emancipation!" He
16498	promised his readers that he would be "harsh as truth and uncompromising
16499	as justice"; that he would not "think or speak or write with
16500	moderation." Then he flung out his defiant call: "I am in earnest--I
16501	will not equivocate--I will not excuse--I will not retreat a single
16502	inch--and I will be heard....
16503	
16504	     'Such is the vow I take, so help me God.'"
16505	
16506	Though Garrison complained that "the apathy of the people is enough to
16507	make every statue leap from its pedestal," he soon learned how alive the
16508	masses were to the meaning of his propaganda. Abolition orators were
16509	stoned in the street and hissed from the platform. Their meeting places
16510	were often attacked and sometimes burned to the ground. Garrison himself
16511	was assaulted in the streets of Boston, finding refuge from the angry
16512	mob behind prison bars. Lovejoy, a publisher in Alton, Illinois, for his
16513	willingness to give abolition a fair hearing, was brutally murdered; his
16514	printing press was broken to pieces as a warning to all those who
16515	disturbed the nation's peace of mind. The South, doubly frightened by a
16516	slave revolt in 1831 which ended in the murder of a number of men,
16517	women, and children, closed all discussion of slavery in that section.
16518	"Now," exclaimed Calhoun, "it is a question which admits of neither
16519	concession nor compromise."
16520	
16521	As the opposition hardened, the anti-slavery agitation gathered in force
16522	and intensity. Whittier blew his blast from the New England hills:
16523	
16524	    "No slave-hunt in our borders--no pirate on our strand;
16525	     No fetters in the Bay State--no slave upon our land."
16526	
16527	Lowell, looking upon the espousal of a great cause as the noblest aim of
16528	his art, ridiculed and excoriated bondage in the South. Those
16529	abolitionists, not gifted as speakers or writers, signed petitions
16530	against slavery and poured them in upon Congress. The flood of them was
16531	so continuous that the House of Representatives, forgetting its
16532	traditions, adopted in 1836 a "gag rule" which prevented the reading of
16533	appeals and consigned them to the waste basket. Not until the Whigs were
16534	in power nearly ten years later was John Quincy Adams able, after a
16535	relentless campaign, to carry a motion rescinding the rule.
16536	
16537	How deep was the impression made upon the country by this agitation for
16538	immediate and unconditional emancipation cannot be measured. If the
16539	popular vote for those candidates who opposed not slavery, but its
16540	extension to the territories, be taken as a standard, it was slight
16541	indeed. In 1844, the Free Soil candidate, Birney, polled 62,000 votes
16542	out of over a million and a half; the Free Soil vote of the next
16543	campaign went beyond a quarter of a million, but the increase was due to
16544	the strength of the leader, Martin Van Buren; four years afterward it
16545	receded to 156,000, affording all the outward signs for the belief that
16546	the pleas of the abolitionist found no widespread response among the
16547	people. Yet the agitation undoubtedly ran deeper than the ballot box.
16548	Young statesmen of the North, in whose hands the destiny of frightful
16549	years was to lie, found their indifference to slavery broken and their
16550	consciences stirred by the unending appeal and the tireless reiteration.
16551	Charles Sumner afterward boasted that he read the _Liberator_ two years
16552	before Wendell Phillips, the young Boston lawyer who cast aside his
16553	profession to take up the dangerous cause.
16554	
16555	=Early Southern Opposition to Slavery.=--In the South, the sentiment
16556	against slavery was strong; it led some to believe that it would also
16557	come to an end there in due time. Washington disliked it and directed in
16558	his will that his own slaves should be set free after the death of his
16559	wife. Jefferson, looking into the future, condemned the system by which
16560	he also lived, saying: "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure
16561	when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of
16562	the people that their liberties are the gift of God? Are they not to be
16563	violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I
16564	reflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever." Nor
16565	did Southern men confine their sentiments to expressions of academic
16566	opinion. They accepted in 1787 the Ordinance which excluded slavery from
16567	the Northwest territory forever and also the Missouri Compromise, which
16568	shut it out of a vast section of the Louisiana territory.
16569	
16570	=The Revolution in the Slave System.=--Among the representatives of
16571	South Carolina and Georgia, however, the anti-slavery views of
16572	Washington and Jefferson were by no means approved; and the drift of
16573	Southern economy was decidedly in favor of extending and perpetuating,
16574	rather than abolishing, the system of chattel servitude. The invention
16575	of the cotton gin and textile machinery created a market for cotton
16576	which the planters, with all their skill and energy, could hardly
16577	supply. Almost every available acre was brought under cotton culture as
16578	the small farmers were driven steadily from the seaboard into the
16579	uplands or to the Northwest.
16580	
16581	The demand for slaves to till the swiftly expanding fields was enormous.
16582	The number of bondmen rose from 700,000 in Washington's day to more than
16583	three millions in 1850. At the same time slavery itself was transformed.
16584	Instead of the homestead where the same family of masters kept the same
16585	families of slaves from generation to generation, came the plantation
16586	system of the Far South and Southwest where masters were ever moving and
16587	ever extending their holdings of lands and slaves. This in turn reacted
16588	on the older South where the raising of slaves for the market became a
16589	regular and highly profitable business.
16590	
16591	[Illustration: _From an old print_
16592	
16593	JOHN C. CALHOUN]
16594	
16595	=Slavery Defended as a Positive Good.=--As the abolition agitation
16596	increased and the planting system expanded, apologies for slavery became
16597	fainter and fainter in the South. Then apologies were superseded by
16598	claims that slavery was a beneficial scheme of labor control. Calhoun,
16599	in a famous speech in the Senate in 1837, sounded the new note by
16600	declaring slavery "instead of an evil, a good--a positive good." His
16601	reasoning was as follows: in every civilized society one portion of the
16602	community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the
16603	arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his
16604	master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than
16605	the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts
16606	between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this
16607	respect, he concluded, "will become more and more manifest, if left
16608	undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in
16609	wealth and numbers."
16610	
16611	=Slave Owners Dominate Politics.=--The new doctrine of Calhoun was
16612	eagerly seized by the planters as they came more and more to overshadow
16613	the small farmers of the South and as they beheld the menace of
16614	abolition growing upon the horizon. It formed, as they viewed matters, a
16615	moral defense for their labor system--sound, logical, invincible. It
16616	warranted them in drawing together for the protection of an institution
16617	so necessary, so inevitable, so beneficent.
16618	
16619	Though in 1850 the slave owners were only about three hundred and fifty
16620	thousand in a national population of nearly twenty million whites, they
16621	had an influence all out of proportion to their numbers. They were knit
16622	together by the bonds of a common interest. They had leisure and wealth.
16623	They could travel and attend conferences and conventions. Throughout the
16624	South and largely in the North, they had the press, the schools, and the
16625	pulpits on their side. They formed, as it were, a mighty union for the
16626	protection and advancement of their common cause. Aided by those
16627	mechanics and farmers of the North who stuck by Jacksonian Democracy
16628	through thick and thin, the planters became a power in the federal
16629	government. "We nominate Presidents," exultantly boasted a Richmond
16630	newspaper; "the North elects them."
16631	
16632	This jubilant Southern claim was conceded by William H. Seward, a
16633	Republican Senator from New York, in a speech describing the power of
16634	slavery in the national government. "A party," he said, "is in one sense
16635	a joint stock association, in which those who contribute most direct the
16636	action and management of the concern.... The slaveholders, contributing
16637	in an overwhelming proportion to the strength of the Democratic party,
16638	necessarily dictate and prescribe its policy." He went on: "The
16639	slaveholding class has become the governing power in each of the
16640	slaveholding states and it practically chooses thirty of the sixty-two
16641	members of the Senate, ninety of the two hundred and thirty-three
16642	members of the House of Representatives, and one hundred and five of the
16643	two hundred and ninety-five electors of President and Vice-President of
16644	the United States." Then he considered the slave power in the Supreme
16645	Court. "That tribunal," he exclaimed, "consists of a chief justice and
16646	eight associate justices. Of these, five were called from slave states
16647	and four from free states. The opinions and bias of each of them were
16648	carefully considered by the President and Senate when he was appointed.
16649	Not one of them was found wanting in soundness of politics, according to
16650	the slaveholder's exposition of the Constitution." Such was the Northern
16651	view of the planting interest that, from the arena of national politics,
16652	challenged the whole country in 1860.

16657	SLAVERY IN NATIONAL POLITICS
16658	
16659	=National Aspects of Slavery.=--It may be asked why it was that slavery,
16660	founded originally on state law and subject to state government, was
16661	drawn into the current of national affairs. The answer is simple. There
16662	were, in the first place, constitutional reasons. The Congress of the
16663	United States had to make all needful rules for the government of the
16664	territories, the District of Columbia, the forts and other property
16665	under national authority; so it was compelled to determine whether
16666	slavery should exist in the places subject to its jurisdiction. Upon
16667	Congress was also conferred the power of admitting new states; whenever
16668	a territory asked for admission, the issue could be raised as to whether
16669	slavery should be sanctioned or excluded. Under the Constitution,
16670	provision was made for the return of runaway slaves; Congress had the
16671	power to enforce this clause by appropriate legislation. Since the
16672	control of the post office was vested in the federal government, it had
16673	to face the problem raised by the transmission of abolition literature
16674	through the mails. Finally citizens had the right of petition; it
16675	inheres in all free government and it is expressly guaranteed by the
16676	first amendment to the Constitution. It was therefore legal for
16677	abolitionists to present to Congress their petitions, even if they asked
16678	for something which it had no right to grant. It was thus impossible,
16679	constitutionally, to draw a cordon around the slavery issue and confine
16680	the discussion of it to state politics.
16681	
16682	There were, in the second place, economic reasons why slavery was
16683	inevitably drawn into the national sphere. It was the basis of the
16684	planting system which had direct commercial relations with the North and
16685	European countries; it was affected by federal laws respecting tariffs,
16686	bounties, ship subsidies, banking, and kindred matters. The planters of
16687	the South, almost without exception, looked upon the protective tariff
16688	as a tribute laid upon them for the benefit of Northern industries. As
16689	heavy borrowers of money in the North, they were generally in favor of
16690	"easy money," if not paper currency, as an aid in the repayment of their
16691	debts. This threw most of them into opposition to the Whig program for a
16692	United States Bank. All financial aids to American shipping they stoutly
16693	resisted, preferring to rely upon the cheaper service rendered by
16694	English shippers. Internal improvements, those substantial ties that
16695	were binding the West to the East and turning the traffic from New
16696	Orleans to Philadelphia and New York, they viewed with alarm. Free
16697	homesteads from the public lands, which tended to overbalance the South
16698	by building free states, became to them a measure dangerous to their
16699	interests. Thus national economic policies, which could not by any twist
16700	or turn be confined to state control, drew the slave system and its
16701	defenders into the political conflict that centered at Washington.
16702	
16703	=Slavery and the Territories--the Missouri Compromise (1820).=--Though
16704	men continually talked about "taking slavery out of politics," it could
16705	not be done. By 1818 slavery had become so entrenched and the
16706	anti-slavery sentiment so strong, that Missouri's quest for admission
16707	brought both houses of Congress into a deadlock that was broken only by
16708	compromise. The South, having half the Senators, could prevent the
16709	admission of Missouri stripped of slavery; and the North, powerful in
16710	the House of Representatives, could keep Missouri with slavery out of
16711	the union indefinitely. An adjustment of pretensions was the last
16712	resort. Maine, separated from the parent state of Massachusetts, was
16713	brought into the union with freedom and Missouri with bondage. At the
16714	same time it was agreed that the remainder of the vast Louisiana
16715	territory north of the parallel of 36 o 30' should be, like the old
16716	Northwest, forever free; while the southern portion was left to slavery.
16717	In reality this was an immense gain for liberty. The area dedicated to
16718	free farmers was many times greater than that left to the planters. The
16719	principle was once more asserted that Congress had full power to prevent
16720	slavery in the territories.
16721	
16722	[Illustration: THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE]
16723	
16724	=The Territorial Question Reopened by the Wilmot Proviso.=--To the
16725	Southern leaders, the annexation of Texas and the conquest of Mexico
16726	meant renewed security to the planting interest against the increasing
16727	wealth and population of the North. Texas, it was said, could be divided
16728	into four slave states. The new territories secured by the treaty of
16729	peace with Mexico contained the promise of at least three more. Thus, as
16730	each new free soil state knocked for admission into the union, the
16731	South could demand as the price of its consent a new slave state. No
16732	wonder Southern statesmen saw, in the annexation of Texas and the
16733	conquest of Mexico, slavery and King Cotton triumphant--secure for all
16734	time against adverse legislation. Northern leaders were equally
16735	convinced that the Southern prophecy was true. Abolitionists and
16736	moderate opponents of slavery alike were in despair. Texas, they
16737	lamented, would fasten slavery upon the country forevermore. "No living
16738	man," cried one, "will see the end of slavery in the United States!"
16739	
16740	It so happened, however, that the events which, it was thought, would
16741	secure slavery let loose a storm against it. A sign appeared first on
16742	August 6, 1846, only a few months after war was declared on Mexico. On
16743	that day, David Wilmot, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, introduced into
16744	the House of Representatives a resolution to the effect that, as an
16745	express and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory
16746	from the republic of Mexico, slavery should be forever excluded from
16747	every part of it. "The Wilmot Proviso," as the resolution was popularly
16748	called, though defeated on that occasion, was a challenge to the South.
16749	
16750	The South answered the challenge. Speaking in the House of
16751	Representatives, Robert Toombs of Georgia boldly declared: "In the
16752	presence of the living God, if by your legislation you seek to drive us
16753	from the territories of California and New Mexico ... I am for
16754	disunion." South Carolina announced that the day for talk had passed and
16755	the time had come to join her sister states "in resisting the
16756	application of the Wilmot Proviso at any and all hazards." A conference,
16757	assembled at Jackson, Mississippi, in the autumn of 1849, called a
16758	general convention of Southern states to meet at Nashville the following
16759	summer. The avowed purpose was to arrest "the course of aggression" and,
16760	if that was not possible, to provide "in the last resort for their
16761	separate welfare by the formation of a compact and union that will
16762	afford protection to their liberties and rights." States that had
16763	spurned South Carolina's plea for nullification in 1832 responded to
16764	this new appeal with alacrity--an augury of the secession to come.

16768	HENRY CLAY]
16769	
16770	=The Great Debate of 1850.=--The temper of the country was white hot
16771	when Congress convened in December, 1849. It was a memorable session,
16772	memorable for the great men who took part in the debates and memorable
16773	for the grand Compromise of 1850 which it produced. In the Senate sat
16774	for the last time three heroic figures: Webster from the North, Calhoun
16775	from the South, and Clay from a border state. For nearly forty years
16776	these three had been leaders of men. All had grown old and gray in
16777	service. Calhoun was already broken in health and in a few months was to
16778	be borne from the political arena forever. Clay and Webster had but two
16779	more years in their allotted span.
16780	
16781	Experience, learning, statecraft--all these things they now marshaled in
16782	a mighty effort to solve the slavery problem. On January 29, 1850, Clay
16783	offered to the Senate a compromise granting concessions to both sides;
16784	and a few days later, in a powerful oration, he made a passionate appeal
16785	for a union of hearts through mutual sacrifices. Calhoun relentlessly
16786	demanded the full measure of justice for the South: equal rights in the
16787	territories bought by common blood; the return of runaway slaves as
16788	required by the Constitution; the suppression of the abolitionists; and
16789	the restoration of the balance of power between the North and the South.
16790	Webster, in his notable "Seventh of March speech," condemned the Wilmot
16791	Proviso, advocated a strict enforcement of the fugitive slave law,
16792	denounced the abolitionists, and made a final plea for the Constitution,
16793	union, and liberty. This was the address which called forth from
16794	Whittier the poem, "Ichabod," deploring the fall of the mighty one whom
16795	he thought lost to all sense of faith and honor.
16796	
16797	=The Terms of the Compromise of 1850.=--When the debates were closed,
16798	the results were totaled in a series of compromise measures, all of
16799	which were signed in September, 1850, by the new President, Millard
16800	Fillmore, who had taken office two months before on the death of Zachary
16801	Taylor. By these acts the boundaries of Texas were adjusted and the
16802	territory of New Mexico created, subject to the provision that all or
16803	any part of it might be admitted to the union "with or without slavery
16804	as their constitution may provide at the time of their admission." The
16805	Territory of Utah was similarly organized with the same conditions as to
16806	slavery, thus repudiating the Wilmot Proviso without guaranteeing
16807	slavery to the planters. California was admitted as a free state under a
16808	constitution in which the people of the territory had themselves
16809	prohibited slavery.
16810	
16811	The slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia, but slavery
16812	itself existed as before at the capital of the nation. This concession
16813	to anti-slavery sentiment was more than offset by a fugitive slave law,
16814	drastic in spirit and in letter. It placed the enforcement of its terms
16815	in the hands of federal officers appointed from Washington and so
16816	removed it from the control of authorities locally elected. It provided
16817	that masters or their agents, on filing claims in due form, might
16818	summarily remove their escaped slaves without affording their "alleged
16819	fugitives" the right of trial by jury, the right to witness, the right
16820	to offer any testimony in evidence. Finally, to "put teeth" into the
16821	act, heavy penalties were prescribed for all who obstructed or assisted
16822	in obstructing the enforcement of the law. Such was the Great Compromise
16823	of 1850.
16824	
16825	[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON REPRESENTING WEBSTER "STEALING CLAY'S
16826	THUNDER"]
16827	
16828	=The Pro-slavery Triumph in the Election of 1852.=--The results of the
16829	election of 1852 seemed to show conclusively that the nation was weary
16830	of slavery agitation and wanted peace. Both parties, Whigs and
16831	Democrats, endorsed the fugitive slave law and approved the Great
16832	Compromise. The Democrats, with Franklin Pierce as their leader, swept
16833	the country against the war hero, General Winfield Scott, on whom the
16834	Whigs had staked their hopes. Even Webster, broken with grief at his
16835	failure to receive the nomination, advised his friends to vote for
16836	Pierce and turned away from politics to meditate upon approaching death.
16837	The verdict of the voters would seem to indicate that for the time
16838	everybody, save a handful of disgruntled agitators, looked upon Clay's
16839	settlement as the last word. "The people, especially the business men of
16840	the country," says Elson, "were utterly weary of the agitation and they
16841	gave their suffrages to the party that promised them rest." The Free
16842	Soil party, condemning slavery as "a sin against God and a crime against
16843	man," and advocating freedom for the territories, failed to carry a
16844	single state. In fact it polled fewer votes than it had four years
16845	earlier--156,000 as against nearly 3,000,000, the combined vote of the
16846	Whigs and Democrats. It is not surprising, therefore, that President
16847	Pierce, surrounded in his cabinet by strong Southern sympathizers, could
16848	promise to put an end to slavery agitation and to crush the abolition
16849	movement in the bud.
16850	
16851	=Anti-slavery Agitation Continued.=--The promise was more difficult to
16852	fulfill than to utter. In fact, the vigorous execution of one measure
16853	included in the Compromise--the fugitive slave law--only made matters
16854	worse. Designed as security for the planters, it proved a powerful
16855	instrument in their undoing. Slavery five hundred miles away on a
16856	Louisiana plantation was so remote from the North that only the
16857	strongest imagination could maintain a constant rage against it. "Slave
16858	catching," "man hunting" by federal officers on the streets of
16859	Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Chicago, or Milwaukee and in the hamlets
16860	and villages of the wide-stretching farm lands of the North was another
16861	matter. It brought the most odious aspects of slavery home to thousands
16862	of men and women who would otherwise have been indifferent to the
16863	system. Law-abiding business men, mechanics, farmers, and women, when
16864	they saw peaceful negroes, who had resided in their neighborhoods
16865	perhaps for years, torn away by federal officers and carried back to
16866	bondage, were transformed into enemies of the law. They helped slaves to
16867	escape; they snatched them away from officers who had captured them;
16868	they broke open jails and carried fugitives off to Canada.
16869	
16870	Assistance to runaway slaves, always more or less common in the North,
16871	was by this time organized into a system. Regular routes, known as
16872	"underground railways," were laid out across the free states into
16873	Canada, and trusted friends of freedom maintained "underground stations"
16874	where fugitives were concealed in the daytime between their long night
16875	journeys. Funds were raised and secret agents sent into the South to
16876	help negroes to flee. One negro woman, Harriet Tubman, "the Moses of her
16877	people," with headquarters at Philadelphia, is accredited with nineteen
16878	invasions into slave territory and the emancipation of three hundred
16879	negroes. Those who worked at this business were in constant peril. One
16880	underground operator, Calvin Fairbank, spent nearly twenty years in
16881	prison for aiding fugitives from justice. Yet perils and prisons did not
16882	stay those determined men and women who, in obedience to their
16883	consciences, set themselves to this lawless work.
16884	
16885	[Illustration: HARRIET BEECHER STOWE]
16886	
16887	From thrilling stories of adventure along the underground railways came
16888	some of the scenes and themes of the novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe,
16889	"Uncle Tom's Cabin," published two years after the Compromise of 1850.
16890	Her stirring tale set forth the worst features of slavery in vivid word
16891	pictures that caught and held the attention of millions of readers.
16892	Though the book was unfair to the South and was denounced as a hideous
16893	distortion of the truth, it was quickly dramatized and played in every
16894	city and town throughout the North. Topsy, Little Eva, Uncle Tom, the
16895	fleeing slave, Eliza Harris, and the cruel slave driver, Simon Legree,
16896	with his baying blood hounds, became living specters in many a home that
16897	sought to bar the door to the "unpleasant and irritating business of
16898	slavery agitation."
16899	
16900	
16901	THE DRIFT OF EVENTS TOWARD THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT
16902	
16903	=Repeal of the Missouri Compromise.=--To practical men, after all, the
16904	"rub-a-dub" agitation of a few abolitionists, an occasional riot over
16905	fugitive slaves, and the vogue of a popular novel seemed of slight or
16906	transient importance. They could point with satisfaction to the election
16907	returns of 1852; but their very security was founded upon shifting
16908	sands. The magnificent triumph of the pro-slavery Democrats in 1852
16909	brought a turn in affairs that destroyed the foundations under their
16910	feet. Emboldened by their own strength and the weakness of their
16911	opponents, they now dared to repeal the Missouri Compromise. The leader
16912	in this fateful enterprise was Stephen A. Douglas, Senator from
16913	Illinois, and the occasion for the deed was the demand for the
16914	organization of territorial government in the regions west of Iowa and
16915	Missouri.
16916	
16917	Douglas, like Clay and Webster before him, was consumed by a strong
16918	passion for the presidency, and, to reach his goal, it was necessary to
16919	win the support of the South. This he undoubtedly sought to do when he
16920	introduced on January 4, 1854, a bill organizing the Nebraska territory
16921	on the principle of the Compromise of 1850; namely, that the people in
16922	the territory might themselves decide whether they would have slavery or
16923	not. Unwittingly the avalanche was started.
16924	
16925	After a stormy debate, in which important amendments were forced on
16926	Douglas, the Kansas-Nebraska Bill became a law on May 30, 1854. The
16927	measure created two territories, Kansas and Nebraska, and provided that
16928	they, or territories organized out of them, could come into the union as
16929	states "with or without slavery as their constitutions may prescribe at
16930	the time of their admission." Not content with this, the law went on to
16931	declare the Missouri Compromise null and void as being inconsistent with
16932	the principle of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the states
16933	and territories. Thus by a single blow the very heart of the continent,
16934	dedicated to freedom by solemn agreement, was thrown open to slavery. A
16935	desperate struggle between slave owners and the advocates of freedom was
16936	the outcome in Kansas.
16937	
16938	If Douglas fancied that the North would receive the overthrow of the
16939	Missouri Compromise in the same temper that it greeted Clay's
16940	settlement, he was rapidly disillusioned. A blast of rage, terrific in
16941	its fury, swept from Maine to Iowa. Staid old Boston hanged him in
16942	effigy with an inscription--"Stephen A. Douglas, author of the infamous
16943	Nebraska bill: the Benedict Arnold of 1854." City after city burned him
16944	in effigy until, as he himself said, he could travel from the Atlantic
16945	coast to Chicago in the light of the fires. Thousands of Whigs and
16946	Free-soil Democrats deserted their parties which had sanctioned or at
16947	least tolerated the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, declaring that the startling
16948	measure showed an evident resolve on the part of the planters to rule
16949	the whole country. A gage of defiance was thrown down to the
16950	abolitionists. An issue was set even for the moderate and timid who had
16951	been unmoved by the agitation over slavery in the Far South. That issue
16952	was whether slavery was to be confined within its existing boundaries or
16953	be allowed to spread without interference, thereby placing the free
16954	states in the minority and surrendering the federal government wholly to
16955	the slave power.
16956	
16957	=The Rise of the Republican Party.=--Events of terrible significance,
16958	swiftly following, drove the country like a ship before a gale straight
16959	into civil war. The Kansas-Nebraska Bill rent the old parties asunder
16960	and called into being the Republican party. While that bill was pending
16961	in Congress, many Northern Whigs and Democrats had come to the
16962	conclusion that a new party dedicated to freedom in the territories must
16963	follow the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Several places claim to be
16964	the original home of the Republican party; but historians generally
16965	yield it to Wisconsin. At Ripon in that state, a mass meeting of Whigs
16966	and Democrats assembled in February, 1854, and resolved to form a new
16967	party if the Kansas-Nebraska Bill should pass. At a second meeting a
16968	fusion committee representing Whigs, Free Soilers, and Democrats was
16969	formed and the name Republican--the name of Jefferson's old party--was
16970	selected. All over the country similar meetings were held and political
16971	committees were organized.
16972	
16973	When the presidential campaign of 1856 began the Republicans entered the
16974	contest. After a preliminary conference in Pittsburgh in February, they
16975	held a convention in Philadelphia at which was drawn up a platform
16976	opposing the extension of slavery to the territories. John C. Fremont,
16977	the distinguished explorer, was named for the presidency. The results
16978	of the election were astounding as compared with the Free-soil failure
16979	of the preceding election. Prominent men like Longfellow, Washington
16980	Irving, William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and George William
16981	Curtis went over to the new party and 1,341,264 votes were rolled up for
16982	"free labor, free speech, free men, free Kansas, and Fremont."
16983	Nevertheless the victory of the Democrats was decisive. Their candidate,
16984	James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, was elected by a majority of 174 to 114
16985	electoral votes.
16986	
16987	[Illustration: SLAVE AND FREE SOIL ON EVE OF CIVIL WAR]
16988	
16989	=The Dred Scott Decision (1857).=--In his inaugural, Buchanan vaguely
16990	hinted that in a forthcoming decision the Supreme Court would settle one
16991	of the vital questions of the day. This was a reference to the Dred
16992	Scott case then pending. Scott was a slave who had been taken by his
16993	master into the upper Louisiana territory, where freedom had been
16994	established by the Missouri Compromise, and then carried back into his
16995	old state of Missouri. He brought suit for his liberty on the ground
16996	that his residence in the free territory made him free. This raised the
16997	question whether the law of Congress prohibiting slavery north of 36 o
16998	30' was authorized by the federal Constitution or not. The Court might
16999	have avoided answering it by saying that even though Scott was free in
17000	the territory, he became a slave again in Missouri by virtue of the law
17001	of that state. The Court, however, faced the issue squarely. It held
17002	that Scott had not been free anywhere and that, besides, the Missouri
17003	Compromise violated the Constitution and was null and void.
17004	
17005	The decision was a triumph for the South. It meant that Congress after
17006	all had no power to abolish slavery in the territories. Under the decree
17007	of the highest court in the land, that could be done only by an
17008	amendment to the Constitution which required a two-thirds vote in
17009	Congress and the approval of three-fourths of the states. Such an
17010	amendment was obviously impossible--the Southern states were too
17011	numerous; but the Republicans were not daunted. "We know," said Lincoln,
17012	"the Court that made it has often overruled its own decisions and we
17013	shall do what we can to have it overrule this." Legislatures of Northern
17014	states passed resolutions condemning the decision and the Republican
17015	platform of 1860 characterized the dogma that the Constitution carried
17016	slavery into the territories as "a dangerous political heresy at
17017	variance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself ... with
17018	legislative and judicial precedent ... revolutionary in tendency and
17019	subversive of the peace and harmony of the country."
17020	
17021	=The Panic of 1857.=--In the midst of the acrimonious dispute over the
17022	Dred Scott decision, came one of the worst business panics which ever
17023	afflicted the country. In the spring and summer of 1857, fourteen
17024	railroad corporations, including the Erie, Michigan Central, and the
17025	Illinois Central, failed to meet their obligations; banks and insurance
17026	companies, some of them the largest and strongest institutions in the
17027	North, closed their doors; stocks and bonds came down in a crash on the
17028	markets; manufacturing was paralyzed; tens of thousands of working
17029	people were thrown out of employment; "hunger meetings" of idle men were
17030	held in the cities and banners bearing the inscription, "We want
17031	bread," were flung out. In New York, working men threatened to invade
17032	the Council Chamber to demand "work or bread," and the frightened mayor
17033	called for the police and soldiers. For this distressing state of
17034	affairs many remedies were offered; none with more zeal and persistence
17035	than the proposal for a higher tariff to take the place of the law of
17036	March, 1857, a Democratic measure making drastic reductions in the rates
17037	of duty. In the manufacturing districts of the North, the panic was
17038	ascribed to the "Democratic assault on business." So an old issue was
17039	again vigorously advanced, preparatory to the next presidential
17040	campaign.
17041	
17042	=The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.=--The following year the interest of the
17043	whole country was drawn to a series of debates held in Illinois by
17044	Lincoln and Douglas, both candidates for the United States Senate. In
17045	the course of his campaign Lincoln had uttered his trenchant saying that
17046	"a house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government
17047	cannot endure permanently half slave and half free." At the same time he
17048	had accused Douglas, Buchanan, and the Supreme Court of acting in
17049	concert to make slavery national. This daring statement arrested the
17050	attention of Douglas, who was making his campaign on the doctrine of
17051	"squatter sovereignty;" that is, the right of the people of each
17052	territory "to vote slavery up or down." After a few long-distance shots
17053	at each other, the candidates agreed to meet face to face and discuss
17054	the issues of the day. Never had such crowds been seen at political
17055	meetings in Illinois. Farmers deserted their plows, smiths their forges,
17056	and housewives their baking to hear "Honest Abe" and "the Little Giant."
17057	
17058	The results of the series of debates were momentous. Lincoln clearly
17059	defined his position. The South, he admitted, was entitled under the
17060	Constitution to a fair, fugitive slave law. He hoped that there might be
17061	no new slave states; but he did not see how Congress could exclude the
17062	people of a territory from admission as a state if they saw fit to adopt
17063	a constitution legalizing the ownership of slaves. He favored the
17064	gradual abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and the total
17065	exclusion of it from the territories of the United States by act of
17066	Congress.
17067	
17068	Moreover, he drove Douglas into a hole by asking how he squared
17069	"squatter sovereignty" with the Dred Scott decision; how, in other
17070	words, the people of a territory could abolish slavery when the Court
17071	had declared that Congress, the superior power, could not do it under
17072	the Constitution? To this baffling question Douglas lamely replied that
17073	the inhabitants of a territory, by "unfriendly legislation," might make
17074	property in slaves insecure and thus destroy the institution. This
17075	answer to Lincoln's query alienated many Southern Democrats who believed
17076	that the Dred Scott decision settled the question of slavery in the
17077	territories for all time. Douglas won the election to the Senate; but
17078	Lincoln, lifted into national fame by the debates, beat him in the
17079	campaign for President two years later.
17080	
17081	=John Brown's Raid.=--To the abolitionists the line of argument pursued
17082	by Lincoln, including his proposal to leave slavery untouched in the
17083	states where it existed, was wholly unsatisfactory. One of them, a grim
17084	and resolute man, inflamed by a hatred for slavery in itself, turned
17085	from agitation to violence. "These men are all talk; what is needed is
17086	action--action!" So spoke John Brown of New York. During the sanguinary
17087	struggle in Kansas he hurried to the frontier, gun and dagger in hand,
17088	to help drive slave owners from the free soil of the West. There he
17089	committed deeds of such daring and cruelty that he was outlawed and a
17090	price put upon his head. Still he kept on the path of "action." Aided by
17091	funds from Northern friends, he gathered a small band of his followers
17092	around him, saying to them: "If God be for us, who can be against us?"
17093	He went into Virginia in the autumn of 1859, hoping, as he explained,
17094	"to effect a mighty conquest even though it be like the last victory of
17095	Samson." He seized the government armory at Harper's Ferry, declared
17096	free the slaves whom he found, and called upon them to take up arms in
17097	defense of their liberty. His was a hope as forlorn as it was desperate.
17098	Armed forces came down upon him and, after a hard battle, captured him.
17099	Tried for treason, Brown was condemned to death. The governor of
17100	Virginia turned a deaf ear to pleas for clemency based on the ground
17101	that the prisoner was simply a lunatic. "This is a beautiful country,"
17102	said the stern old Brown glancing upward to the eternal hills on his way
17103	to the gallows, as calmly as if he were returning home from a long
17104	journey. "So perish all such enemies of Virginia. All such enemies of
17105	the Union. All such foes of the human race," solemnly announced the
17106	executioner as he fulfilled the judgment of the law.
17107	
17108	The raid and its grim ending deeply moved the country. Abolitionists
17109	looked upon Brown as a martyr and tolled funeral bells on the day of his
17110	execution. Longfellow wrote in his diary: "This will be a great day in
17111	our history; the date of a new revolution as much needed as the old
17112	one." Jefferson Davis saw in the affair "the invasion of a state by a
17113	murderous gang of abolitionists bent on inciting slaves to murder
17114	helpless women and children"--a crime for which the leader had met a
17115	felon's death. Lincoln spoke of the raid as absurd, the deed of an
17116	enthusiast who had brooded over the oppression of a people until he
17117	fancied himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them--an attempt
17118	which ended in "little else than his own execution." To Republican
17119	leaders as a whole, the event was very embarrassing. They were taunted
17120	by the Democrats with responsibility for the deed. Douglas declared his
17121	"firm and deliberate conviction that the Harper's Ferry crime was the
17122	natural, logical, inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of
17123	the Republican party." So persistent were such attacks that the
17124	Republicans felt called upon in 1860 to denounce Brown's raid "as among
17125	the gravest of crimes."
17126	
17127	=The Democrats Divided.=--When the Democratic convention met at
17128	Charleston in the spring of 1860, a few months after Brown's execution,
17129	it soon became clear that there was danger ahead. Between the extreme
17130	slavery advocates of the Far South and the so-called pro-slavery
17131	Democrats of the Douglas type, there was a chasm which no appeals to
17132	party loyalty could bridge. As the spokesman of the West, Douglas knew
17133	that, while the North was not abolitionist, it was passionately set
17134	against an extension of slavery into the territories by act of Congress;
17135	that squatter sovereignty was the mildest kind of compromise acceptable
17136	to the farmers whose votes would determine the fate of the election.
17137	Southern leaders would not accept his opinion. Yancey, speaking for
17138	Alabama, refused to palter with any plan not built on the proposition
17139	that slavery was in itself right. He taunted the Northern Democrats with
17140	taking the view that slavery was wrong, but that they could not do
17141	anything about it. That, he said, was the fatal error--the cause of all
17142	discord, the source of "Black Republicanism," as well as squatter
17143	sovereignty. The gauntlet was thus thrown down at the feet of the
17144	Northern delegates: "You must not apologize for slavery; you must
17145	declare it right; you must advocate its extension." The challenge, so
17146	bluntly put, was as bluntly answered. "Gentlemen of the South,"
17147	responded a delegate from Ohio, "you mistake us. You mistake us. We will
17148	not do it."
17149	
17150	For ten days the Charleston convention wrangled over the platform and
17151	balloted for the nomination of a candidate. Douglas, though in the lead,
17152	could not get the two-thirds vote required for victory. For more than
17153	fifty times the roll of the convention was called without a decision.
17154	Then in sheer desperation the convention adjourned to meet later at
17155	Baltimore. When the delegates again assembled, their passions ran as
17156	high as ever. The division into two irreconcilable factions was
17157	unchanged. Uncompromising delegates from the South withdrew to Richmond,
17158	nominated John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for President, and put forth
17159	a platform asserting the rights of slave owners in the territories and
17160	the duty of the federal government to protect them. The delegates who
17161	remained at Baltimore nominated Douglas and endorsed his doctrine of
17162	squatter sovereignty.
17163	
17164	=The Constitutional Union Party.=--While the Democratic party was being
17165	disrupted, a fragment of the former Whig party, known as the
17166	Constitutional Unionists, held a convention at Baltimore and selected
17167	national candidates: John Bell from Tennessee and Edward Everett from
17168	Massachusetts. A melancholy interest attached to this assembly. It was
17169	mainly composed of old men whose political views were those of Clay and
17170	Webster, cherished leaders now dead and gone. In their platform they
17171	sought to exorcise the evil spirit of partisanship by inviting their
17172	fellow citizens to "support the Constitution of the country, the union
17173	of the states, and the enforcement of the laws." The party that
17174	campaigned on this grand sentiment only drew laughter from the Democrats
17175	and derision from the Republicans and polled less than one-fourth the
17176	votes.
17177	
17178	=The Republican Convention.=--With the Whigs definitely forced into a
17179	separate group, the Republican convention at Chicago was fated to be
17180	sectional in character, although five slave states did send delegates.
17181	As the Democrats were split, the party that had led a forlorn hope four
17182	years before was on the high road to success at last. New and powerful
17183	recruits were found. The advocates of a high protective tariff and the
17184	friends of free homesteads for farmers and workingmen mingled with
17185	enthusiastic foes of slavery. While still firm in their opposition to
17186	slavery in the territories, the Republicans went on record in favor of a
17187	homestead law granting free lands to settlers and approved customs
17188	duties designed "to encourage the development of the industrial
17189	interests of the whole country." The platform was greeted with cheers
17190	which, according to the stenographic report of the convention, became
17191	loud and prolonged as the protective tariff and homestead planks were
17192	read.
17193	
17194	Having skillfully drawn a platform to unite the North in opposition to
17195	slavery and the planting system, the Republicans were also adroit in
17196	their selection of a candidate. The tariff plank might carry
17197	Pennsylvania, a Democratic state; but Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were
17198	equally essential to success at the polls. The southern counties of
17199	these states were filled with settlers from Virginia, North Carolina,
17200	and Kentucky who, even if they had no love for slavery, were no friends
17201	of abolition. Moreover, remembering the old fight on the United States
17202	Bank in Andrew Jackson's day, they were suspicious of men from the East.
17203	Accordingly, they did not favor the candidacy of Seward, the leading
17204	Republican statesman and "favorite son" of New York.
17205	
17206	After much trading and discussing, the convention came to the conclusion
17207	that Abraham Lincoln of Illinois was the most "available" candidate. He
17208	was of Southern origin, born in Kentucky in 1809, a fact that told
17209	heavily in the campaign in the Ohio Valley. He was a man of the soil,
17210	the son of poor frontier parents, a pioneer who in his youth had labored
17211	in the fields and forests, celebrated far and wide as "honest Abe, the
17212	rail-splitter." It was well-known that he disliked slavery, but was no
17213	abolitionist. He had come dangerously near to Seward's radicalism in his
17214	"house-divided-against-itself" speech but he had never committed himself
17215	to the reckless doctrine that there was a "higher law" than the
17216	Constitution. Slavery in the South he tolerated as a bitter fact;
17217	slavery in the territories he opposed with all his strength. Of his
17218	sincerity there could be no doubt. He was a speaker and writer of
17219	singular power, commanding, by the use of simple and homely language,
17220	the hearts and minds of those who heard him speak or read his printed
17221	words. He had gone far enough in his opposition to slavery; but not too
17222	far. He was the man of the hour! Amid lusty cheers from ten thousand
17223	throats, Lincoln was nominated for the presidency by the Republicans. In
17224	the ensuing election, he carried all the free states except New Jersey.

17312	CHAPTER XV
17313	
17314	THE CIVIL WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION
17315	
17316	
17317	"The irrepressible conflict is about to be visited upon us through the
17318	Black Republican nominee and his fanatical, diabolical Republican
17319	party," ran an appeal to the voters of South Carolina during the
17320	campaign of 1860. If that calamity comes to pass, responded the governor
17321	of the state, the answer should be a declaration of independence. In a
17322	few days the suspense was over. The news of Lincoln's election came
17323	speeding along the wires. Prepared for the event, the editor of the
17324	Charleston _Mercury_ unfurled the flag of his state amid wild cheers
17325	from an excited throng in the streets. Then he seized his pen and wrote:
17326	"The tea has been thrown overboard; the revolution of 1860 has been
17327	initiated." The issue was submitted to the voters in the choice of
17328	delegates to a state convention called to cast off the yoke of the
17329	Constitution.
17330	
17331	
17332	THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY
17333	
17334	=Secession.=--As arranged, the convention of South Carolina assembled in
17335	December and without a dissenting voice passed the ordinance of
17336	secession withdrawing from the union. Bells were rung exultantly, the
17337	roar of cannon carried the news to outlying counties, fireworks lighted
17338	up the heavens, and champagne flowed. The crisis so long expected had
17339	come at last; even the conservatives who had prayed that they might
17340	escape the dreadful crash greeted it with a sigh of relief.
17341	
17342	[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1861
17343	
17344	The border states (in purple) remained loyal.]
17345	
17346	South Carolina now sent forth an appeal to her sister states--states
17347	that had in Jackson's day repudiated nullification as leading to "the
17348	dissolution of the union." The answer that came this time was in a
17349	different vein. A month had hardly elapsed before five other
17350	states--Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana--had
17351	withdrawn from the union. In February, Texas followed. Virginia,
17352	hesitating until the bombardment of Fort Sumter forced a conclusion,
17353	seceded in April; but fifty-five of the one hundred and forty-three
17354	delegates dissented, foreshadowing the creation of the new state of West
17355	Virginia which Congress admitted to the union in 1863. In May, North
17356	Carolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee announced their independence.
17357	
17358	=Secession and the Theories of the Union.=--In severing their relations
17359	with the union, the seceding states denied every point in the Northern
17360	theory of the Constitution. That theory, as every one knows, was
17361	carefully formulated by Webster and elaborated by Lincoln. According to
17362	it, the union was older than the states; it was created before the
17363	Declaration of Independence for the purpose of common defense. The
17364	Articles of Confederation did but strengthen this national bond and the
17365	Constitution sealed it forever. The federal government was not a
17366	creature of state governments. It was erected by the people and derived
17367	its powers directly from them. "It is," said Webster, "the people's
17368	Constitution, the people's government; made for the people; made by the
17369	people; and answerable to the people. The people of the United States
17370	have declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme law." When a
17371	state questions the lawfulness of any act of the federal government, it
17372	cannot nullify that act or withdraw from the union; it must abide by the
17373	decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The union of these
17374	states is perpetual, ran Lincoln's simple argument in the first
17375	inaugural; the federal Constitution has no provision for its own
17376	termination; it can be destroyed only by some action not provided for in
17377	the instrument itself; even if it is a compact among all the states the
17378	consent of all must be necessary to its dissolution; therefore no state
17379	can lawfully get out of the union and acts of violence against the
17380	United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary. This was the system
17381	which he believed himself bound to defend by his oath of office
17382	"registered in heaven."
17383	
17384	All this reasoning Southern statesmen utterly rejected. In their opinion
17385	the thirteen original states won their independence as separate and
17386	sovereign powers. The treaty of peace with Great Britain named them all
17387	and acknowledged them "to be free, sovereign, and independent states."
17388	The Articles of Confederation very explicitly declared that "each state
17389	retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence." The Constitution
17390	was a "league of nations" formed by an alliance of thirteen separate
17391	powers, each one of which ratified the instrument before it was put into
17392	effect. They voluntarily entered the union under the Constitution and
17393	voluntarily they could leave it. Such was the constitutional doctrine of
17394	Hayne, Calhoun, and Jefferson Davis. In seceding, the Southern states
17395	had only to follow legal methods, and the transaction would be correct
17396	in every particular. So conventions were summoned, elections were held,
17397	and "sovereign assemblies of the people" set aside the Constitution in
17398	the same manner as it had been ratified nearly four score years before.
17399	Thus, said the Southern people, the moral judgment was fulfilled and the
17400	letter of the law carried into effect.
17401	
17402	[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS]
17403	
17404	=The Formation of the Confederacy.=--Acting on the call of Mississippi,
17405	a congress of delegates from the seceded states met at Montgomery,
17406	Alabama, and on February 8, 1861, adopted a temporary plan of union. It
17407	selected, as provisional president, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, a
17408	man well fitted by experience and moderation for leadership, a graduate
17409	of West Point, who had rendered distinguished service on the field of
17410	battle in the Mexican War, in public office, and as a member of
17411	Congress.
17412	
17413	In March, a permanent constitution of the Confederate states was
17414	drafted. It was quickly ratified by the states; elections were held in
17415	November; and the government under it went into effect the next year.
17416	This new constitution, in form, was very much like the famous instrument
17417	drafted at Philadelphia in 1787. It provided for a President, a Senate,
17418	and a House of Representatives along almost identical lines. In the
17419	powers conferred upon them, however, there were striking differences.
17420	The right to appropriate money for internal improvements was expressly
17421	withheld; bounties were not to be granted from the treasury nor import
17422	duties so laid as to promote or foster any branch of industry. The
17423	dignity of the state, if any might be bold enough to question it, was
17424	safeguarded in the opening line by the declaration that each acted "in
17425	its sovereign and independent character" in forming the Southern union.
17426	
17427	=Financing the Confederacy.=--No government ever set out upon its career
17428	with more perplexing tasks in front of it. The North had a monetary
17429	system; the South had to create one. The North had a scheme of taxation
17430	that produced large revenues from numerous sources; the South had to
17431	formulate and carry out a financial plan. Like the North, the
17432	Confederacy expected to secure a large revenue from customs duties,
17433	easily collected and little felt among the masses. To this expectation
17434	the blockade of Southern ports inaugurated by Lincoln in April, 1861,
17435	soon put an end. Following the precedent set by Congress under the
17436	Articles of Confederation, the Southern Congress resorted to a direct
17437	property tax apportioned among the states, only to meet the failure that
17438	might have been foretold.
17439	
17440	The Confederacy also sold bonds, the first issue bringing into the
17441	treasury nearly all the specie available in the Southern banks. This
17442	specie by unhappy management was early sent abroad to pay for supplies,
17443	sapping the foundations of a sound currency system. Large amounts of
17444	bonds were sold overseas, commanding at first better terms than those
17445	of the North in the markets of London, Paris, and Amsterdam, many an
17446	English lord and statesman buying with enthusiasm and confidence to
17447	lament within a few years the proofs of his folly. The difficulties of
17448	bringing through the blockade any supplies purchased by foreign bond
17449	issues, however, nullified the effect of foreign credit and forced the
17450	Confederacy back upon the device of paper money. In all approximately
17451	one billion dollars streamed from the printing presses, to fall in value
17452	at an alarming rate, reaching in January, 1863, the astounding figure of
17453	fifty dollars in paper money for one in gold. Every known device was
17454	used to prevent its depreciation, without result. To the issues of the
17455	Confederate Congress were added untold millions poured out by the states
17456	and by private banks.
17457	
17458	=Human and Material Resources.=--When we measure strength for strength
17459	in those signs of power--men, money, and supplies--it is difficult to
17460	see how the South was able to embark on secession and war with such
17461	confidence in the outcome. In the Confederacy at the final reckoning
17462	there were eleven states in all, to be pitted against twenty-two; a
17463	population of nine millions, nearly one-half servile, to be pitted
17464	against twenty-two millions; a land without great industries to produce
17465	war supplies and without vast capital to furnish war finances, joined in
17466	battle with a nation already industrial and fortified by property worth
17467	eleven billion dollars. Even after the Confederate Congress authorized
17468	conscription in 1862, Southern man power, measured in numbers, was
17469	wholly inadequate to uphold the independence which had been declared.
17470	How, therefore, could the Confederacy hope to sustain itself against
17471	
17472	such a combination of men, money, and materials as the North could
17473	marshal?
17474	
17475	=Southern Expectations.=--The answer to this question is to be found in
17476	the ideas that prevailed among Southern leaders. First of all, they
17477	hoped, in vain, to carry the Confederacy up to the Ohio River; and, with
17478	the aid of Missouri, to gain possession of the Mississippi Valley, the
17479	granary of the nation. In the second place, they reckoned upon a large
17480	and continuous trade with Great Britain--the exchange of cotton for war
17481	materials. They likewise expected to receive recognition and open aid
17482	from European powers that looked with satisfaction upon the breakup of
17483	the great American republic. In the third place, they believed that
17484	their control over several staples so essential to Northern industry
17485	would enable them to bring on an industrial crisis in the manufacturing
17486	states. "I firmly believe," wrote Senator Hammond, of South Carolina, in
17487	1860, "that the slave-holding South is now the controlling power of the
17488	world; that no other power would face us in hostility. Cotton, rice,
17489	tobacco, and naval stores command the world; and we have the sense to
17490	know it and are sufficiently Teutonic to carry it out successfully. The
17491	North without us would be a motherless calf, bleating about, and die of
17492	mange and starvation."
17493	
17494	There were other grounds for confidence. Having seized all of the
17495	federal military and naval supplies in the South, and having left the
17496	national government weak in armed power during their possession of the
17497	presidency, Southern leaders looked to a swift war, if it came at all,
17498	to put the finishing stroke to independence. "The greasy mechanics of
17499	the North," it was repeatedly said, "will not fight." As to disparity in
17500	numbers they drew historic parallels. "Our fathers, a mere handful,
17501	overcame the enormous power of Great Britain," a saying of ex-President
17502	Tyler, ran current to reassure the doubtful. Finally, and this point
17503	cannot be too strongly emphasized, the South expected to see a weakened
17504	and divided North. It knew that the abolitionists and the Southern
17505	sympathizers were ready to let the Confederate states go in peace; that
17506	Lincoln represented only a little more than one-third the voters of the
17507	country; and that the vote for Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge meant a
17508	decided opposition to the Republicans and their policies.
17509	
17510	=Efforts at Compromise.=--Republican leaders, on reviewing the same
17511	facts, were themselves uncertain as to the outcome of a civil war and
17512	made many efforts to avoid a crisis. Thurlow Weed, an Albany journalist
17513	and politician who had done much to carry New York for Lincoln, proposed
17514	a plan for extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific.
17515	Jefferson Davis, warning his followers that a war if it came would be
17516	terrible, was prepared to accept the offer; but Lincoln, remembering his
17517	campaign pledges, stood firm as a rock against it. His followers in
17518	Congress took the same position with regard to a similar settlement
17519	suggested by Senator Crittenden of Kentucky.
17520	
17521	Though unwilling to surrender his solemn promises respecting slavery in
17522	the territories, Lincoln was prepared to give to Southern leaders a
17523	strong guarantee that his administration would not interfere directly or
17524	indirectly with slavery in the states. Anxious to reassure the South on
17525	this point, the Republicans in Congress proposed to write into the
17526	Constitution a declaration that no amendment should ever be made
17527	authorizing the abolition of or interference with slavery in any state.
17528	The resolution, duly passed, was sent forth on March 4, 1861, with the
17529	approval of Lincoln; it was actually ratified by three states before the
17530	storm of war destroyed it. By the irony of fate the thirteenth amendment
17531	was to abolish, not guarantee, slavery.
17532	
17533	
17534	THE WAR MEASURES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
17535	
17536	=Raising the Armies.=--The crisis at Fort Sumter, on April 12-14, 1861,
17537	forced the President and Congress to turn from negotiations to problems
17538	of warfare. Little did they realize the magnitude of the task before
17539	them. Lincoln's first call for volunteers, issued on April 15, 1861,
17540	limited the number to 75,000, put their term of service at three months,
17541	and prescribed their duty as the enforcement of the law against
17542	combinations too powerful to be overcome by ordinary judicial process.
17543	Disillusionment swiftly followed. The terrible defeat of the Federals at
17544	Bull Run on July 21 revealed the serious character of the task before
17545	them; and by a series of measures Congress put the entire man power of
17546	the country at the President's command. Under these acts, he issued new
17547	calls for volunteers. Early in August, 1862, he ordered a draft of
17548	militiamen numbering 300,000 for nine months' service. The results were
17549	disappointing--ominous--for only about 87,000 soldiers were added to the
17550	army. Something more drastic was clearly necessary.
17551	
17552	In March, 1863, Lincoln signed the inevitable draft law; it enrolled in
17553	the national forces liable to military duty all able-bodied male
17554	citizens and persons of foreign birth who had declared their intention
17555	to become citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five
17556	years--with exemptions on grounds of physical weakness and dependency.
17557	From the men enrolled were drawn by lot those destined to active
17558	service. Unhappily the measure struck a mortal blow at the principle of
17559	universal liability by excusing any person who found a substitute for
17560	himself or paid into the war office a sum, not exceeding three hundred
17561	dollars, to be fixed by general order. This provision, so crass and so
17562	obviously favoring the well-to-do, sowed seeds of bitterness which
17563	sprang up a hundredfold in the North.
17564	
17565	[Illustration: THE DRAFT RIOTS IN NEW YORK CITY]
17566	
17567	The beginning of the drawings under the draft act in New York City, on
17568	Monday, July 13, 1863, was the signal for four days of rioting. In the
17569	course of this uprising, draft headquarters were destroyed; the office
17570	of the _Tribune_ was gutted; negroes were seized, hanged, and shot; the
17571	homes of obnoxious Unionists were burned down; the residence of the
17572	mayor of the city was attacked; and regular battles were fought in the
17573	streets between the rioters and the police. Business stopped and a large
17574	part of the city passed absolutely into the control of the mob. Not
17575	until late the following Wednesday did enough troops arrive to restore
17576	order and enable the residents of the city to resume their daily
17577	activities. At least a thousand people had been killed or wounded and
17578	more than a million dollars' worth of damage done to property. The draft
17579	temporarily interrupted by this outbreak was then resumed and carried
17580	out without further trouble.
17581	
17582	The results of the draft were in the end distinctly disappointing to the
17583	government. The exemptions were numerous and the number who preferred
17584	and were able to pay $300 rather than serve exceeded all expectations.
17585	Volunteering, it is true, was stimulated, but even that resource could
17586	hardly keep the thinning ranks of the army filled. With reluctance
17587	Congress struck out the $300 exemption clause, but still favored the
17588	well-to-do by allowing them to hire substitutes if they could find them.
17589	With all this power in its hands the administration was able by January,
17590	1865, to construct a union army that outnumbered the Confederates two to
17591	one.
17592	
17593	=War Finance.=--In the financial sphere the North faced immense
17594	difficulties. The surplus in the treasury had been dissipated by 1861
17595	and the tariff of 1857 had failed to produce an income sufficient to
17596	meet the ordinary expenses of the government. Confronted by military and
17597	naval expenditures of appalling magnitude, rising from $35,000,000 in
17598	the first year of the war to $1,153,000,000 in the last year, the
17599	administration had to tap every available source of income. The duties
17600	on imports were increased, not once but many times, producing huge
17601	revenues and also meeting the most extravagant demands of the
17602	manufacturers for protection. Direct taxes were imposed on the states
17603	according to their respective populations, but the returns were
17604	meager--all out of proportion to the irritation involved. Stamp taxes
17605	and taxes on luxuries, occupations, and the earnings of corporations
17606	were laid with a weight that, in ordinary times, would have drawn forth
17607	opposition of ominous strength. The whole gamut of taxation was run.
17608	Even a tax on incomes and gains by the year, the first in the history of
17609	the federal government, was included in the long list.
17610	
17611	Revenues were supplemented by bond issues, mounting in size and interest
17612	rate, until in October, at the end of the war, the debt stood at
17613	$2,208,000,000. The total cost of the war was many times the money value
17614	of all the slaves in the Southern states. To the debt must be added
17615	nearly half a billion dollars in "greenbacks"--paper money issued by
17616	Congress in desperation as bond sales and revenues from taxes failed to
17617	meet the rising expenditures. This currency issued at par on
17618	questionable warrant from the Constitution, like all such paper, quickly
17619	began to decline until in the worst fortunes of 1864 one dollar in gold
17620	was worth nearly three in greenbacks.
17621	
17622	=The Blockade of Southern Ports.=--Four days after his call for
17623	volunteers, April 19, 1861, President Lincoln issued a proclamation
17624	blockading the ports of the Southern Confederacy. Later the blockade was
17625	extended to Virginia and North Carolina, as they withdrew from the
17626	union. Vessels attempting to enter or leave these ports, if they
17627	disregarded the warnings of a blockading ship, were to be captured and
17628	brought as prizes to the nearest convenient port. To make the order
17629	effective, immediate steps were taken to increase the naval forces,
17630	depleted by neglect, until the entire coast line was patrolled with such
17631	a number of ships that it was a rare captain who ventured to run the
17632	gantlet. The collision between the _Merrimac_ and the _Monitor_ in
17633	March, 1862, sealed the fate of the Confederacy. The exploits of the
17634	union navy are recorded in the falling export of cotton: $202,000,000 in
17635	1860; $42,000,000 in 1861; and $4,000,000 in 1862.
17636	
17637	The deadly effect of this paralysis of trade upon Southern war power may
17638	be readily imagined. Foreign loans, payable in cotton, could be
17639	negotiated but not paid off. Supplies could be purchased on credit but
17640	not brought through the drag net. With extreme difficulty could the
17641	Confederate government secure even paper for the issue of money and
17642	bonds. Publishers, in despair at the loss of supplies, were finally
17643	driven to the use of brown wrapping paper and wall paper. As the
17644	railways and rolling stock wore out, it became impossible to renew them
17645	from England or France. Unable to export their cotton, planters on the
17646	seaboard burned it in what were called "fires of patriotism." In their
17647	lurid light the fatal weakness of Southern economy stood revealed.
17648	
17649	[Illustration: A BLOCKADE RUNNER]
17650	
17651	=Diplomacy.=--The war had not advanced far before the federal government
17652	became involved in many perplexing problems of diplomacy in Europe. The
17653	Confederacy early turned to England and France for financial aid and for
17654	recognition as an independent power. Davis believed that the industrial
17655	crisis created by the cotton blockade would in time literally compel
17656	Europe to intervene in order to get this essential staple. The crisis
17657	came as he expected but not the result. Thousands of English textile
17658	workers were thrown out of employment; and yet, while on the point of
17659	starvation, they adopted resolutions favoring the North instead of
17660	petitioning their government to aid the South by breaking the blockade.
17661	
17662	With the ruling classes it was far otherwise. Napoleon III, the Emperor
17663	of the French, was eager to help in disrupting the American republic; if
17664	he could have won England's support, he would have carried out his
17665	designs. As it turned out he found plenty of sympathy across the Channel
17666	but not open and official cooperation. According to the eminent
17667	historian, Rhodes, "four-fifths of the British House of Lords and most
17668	members of the House of Commons were favorable to the Confederacy and
17669	anxious for its triumph." Late in 1862 the British ministers, thus
17670	sustained, were on the point of recognizing the independence of the
17671	Confederacy. Had it not been for their extreme caution, for the constant
17672	and harassing criticism by English friends of the United States--like
17673	John Bright--and for the victories of Vicksburg and Gettysburg, both
17674	
17675	England and France would have doubtless declared the Confederacy to be
17676	one of the independent powers of the earth.
17677	
17678	[Illustration: JOHN BRIGHT]
17679	
17680	While stopping short of recognizing its independence, England and France
17681	took several steps that were in favor of the South. In proclaiming
17682	neutrality, they early accepted the Confederates as "belligerents" and
17683	accorded them the rights of people at war--a measure which aroused anger
17684	in the North at first but was later admitted to be sound. Otherwise
17685	Confederates taken in battle would have been regarded as "rebels" or
17686	"traitors" to be hanged or shot. Napoleon III proposed to Russia in 1861
17687	a coalition of powers against the North, only to meet a firm refusal.
17688	The next year he suggested intervention to Great Britain, encountering
17689	this time a conditional rejection of his plans. In 1863, not daunted by
17690	rebuffs, he offered his services to Lincoln as a mediator, receiving in
17691	reply a polite letter declining his proposal and a sharp resolution from
17692	Congress suggesting that he attend to his own affairs.
17693	
17694	In both England and France the governments pursued a policy of
17695	friendliness to the Confederate agents. The British ministry, with
17696	indifference if not connivance, permitted rams and ships to be built in
17697	British docks and allowed them to escape to play havoc under the
17698	Confederate flag with American commerce. One of them, the _Alabama_,
17699	built in Liverpool by a British firm and paid for by bonds sold in
17700	England, ran an extraordinary career and threatened to break the
17701	blockade. The course followed by the British government, against the
17702	protests of the American minister in London, was later regretted. By an
17703	award of a tribunal of arbitration at Geneva in 1872, Great Britain was
17704	required to pay the huge sum of $15,500,000 to cover the damages wrought
17705	by Confederate cruisers fitted out in England.
17706	
17707	[Illustration: WILLIAM H. SEWARD]
17708	
17709	In all fairness it should be said that the conduct of the North
17710	contributed to the irritation between the two countries. Seward, the
17711	Secretary of State, was vindictive in dealing with Great Britain; had it
17712	not been for the moderation of Lincoln, he would have pursued a course
17713	verging in the direction of open war. The New York and Boston papers
17714	were severe in their attacks on England. Words were, on one occasion at
17715	least, accompanied by an act savoring of open hostility. In November,
17716	1861, Captain Wilkes, commanding a union vessel, overhauled the British
17717	steamer _Trent_, and carried off by force two Confederate agents, Mason
17718	and Slidell, sent by President Davis to represent the Confederacy at
17719	London and Paris respectively. This was a clear violation of the right
17720	of merchant vessels to be immune from search and impressment; and, in
17721	answer to the demand of Great Britain for the release of the two men,
17722	the United States conceded that it was in the wrong. It surrendered the
17723	two Confederate agents to a British vessel for safe conduct abroad, and
17724	made appropriate apologies.
17725	
17726	=Emancipation.=--Among the extreme war measures adopted by the Northern
17727	government must be counted the emancipation of the slaves in the states
17728	in arms against the union. This step was early and repeatedly suggested
17729	to Lincoln by the abolitionists; but was steadily put aside. He knew
17730	that the abolitionists were a mere handful, that emancipation might
17731	drive the border states into secession, and that the Northern soldiers
17732	had enlisted to save the union. Moreover, he had before him a solemn
17733	resolution passed by Congress on July 22, 1861, declaring the sole
17734	purpose of the war to be the salvation of the union and disavowing any
17735	intention of interfering with slavery.
17736	
17737	The federal government, though pledged to the preservation of slavery,
17738	soon found itself beaten back upon its course and out upon a new tack.
17739	Before a year had elapsed, namely on April 10, 1862, Congress resolved
17740	that financial aid should be given to any state that might adopt gradual
17741	emancipation. Six days later it abolished slavery in the District of
17742	Columbia. Two short months elapsed. On June 19, 1862, it swept slavery
17743	forever from the territories of the United States. Chief Justice Taney
17744	still lived, the Dred Scott decision stood as written in the book, but
17745	the Constitution had been re-read in the light of the Civil War. The
17746	drift of public sentiment in the North was being revealed.
17747	
17748	While these measures were pending in Congress, Lincoln was slowly making
17749	up his mind. By July of that year he had come to his great decision.
17750	Near the end of that month he read to his cabinet the draft of a
17751	proclamation of emancipation; but he laid it aside until a military
17752	achievement would make it something more than an idle gesture. In
17753	September, the severe check administered to Lee at Antietam seemed to
17754	offer the golden opportunity. On the 22d, the immortal document was
17755	given to the world announcing that, unless the states in arms returned
17756	to the union by January 1, 1863, the fatal blow at their "peculiar
17757	institution" would be delivered. Southern leaders treated it with slight
17758	regard, and so on the date set the promise was fulfilled. The
17759	proclamation was issued as a war measure, adopted by the President as
17760	commander-in-chief of the armed forces, on grounds of military
17761	necessity. It did not abolish slavery. It simply emancipated slaves in
17762	places then in arms against federal authority. Everywhere else slavery,
17763	as far as the Proclamation was concerned, remained lawful.
17764	
17765	[Illustration: ABRAHAM LINCOLN]
17766	
17767	To seal forever the proclamation of emancipation, and to extend freedom
17768	to the whole country, Congress, in January, 1865, on the urgent
17769	recommendation of Lincoln, transmitted to the states the thirteenth
17770	amendment, abolishing slavery throughout the United States. By the end
17771	of 1865 the amendment was ratified. The house was not divided against
17772	itself; it did not fall; it was all free.
17773	
17774	=The Restraint of Civil Liberty.=--As in all great wars, particularly
17775	those in the nature of a civil strife, it was found necessary to use
17776	strong measures to sustain opinion favorable to the administration's
17777	military policies and to frustrate the designs of those who sought to
17778	hamper its action. Within two weeks of his first call for volunteers,
17779	Lincoln empowered General Scott to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_
17780	along the line of march between Philadelphia and Washington and thus to
17781	arrest and hold without interference from civil courts any one whom he
17782	deemed a menace to the union. At a later date the area thus ruled by
17783	military officers was extended by executive proclamation. By an act of
17784	March 3, 1863, Congress, desiring to lay all doubts about the
17785	President's power, authorized him to suspend the writ throughout the
17786	United States or in any part thereof. It also freed military officers
17787	from the necessity of surrendering to civil courts persons arrested
17788	under their orders, or even making answers to writs issued from such
17789	courts. In the autumn of that year the President, acting under the terms
17790	of this law, declared this ancient and honorable instrument for the
17791	protection of civil liberties, the _habeas corpus_, suspended throughout
17792	the length and breadth of the land. The power of the government was also
17793	strengthened by an act defining and punishing certain conspiracies,
17794	passed on July 31, 1861--a measure which imposed heavy penalties on
17795	those who by force, intimidation, or threat interfered with the
17796	execution of the law.
17797	
17798	Thus doubly armed, the military authorities spared no one suspected of
17799	active sympathy with the Southern cause. Editors were arrested and
17800	imprisoned, their papers suspended, and their newsboys locked up. Those
17801	who organized "peace meetings" soon found themselves in the toils of the
17802	law. Members of the Maryland legislature, the mayor of Baltimore, and
17803	local editors suspected of entertaining secessionist opinions, were
17804	imprisoned on military orders although charged with no offense, and were
17805	denied the privilege of examination before a civil magistrate. A Vermont
17806	farmer, too outspoken in his criticism of the government, found himself
17807	behind the bars until the government, in its good pleasure, saw fit to
17808	release him. These measures were not confined to the theater of war nor
17809	to the border states where the spirit of secession was strong enough to
17810	endanger the cause of union. They were applied all through the Northern
17811	states up to the very boundaries of Canada. Zeal for the national cause,
17812	too often supplemented by a zeal for persecution, spread terror among
17813	those who wavered in the singleness of their devotion to the union.
17814	
17815	These drastic operations on the part of military authorities, so foreign
17816	to the normal course of civilized life, naturally aroused intense and
17817	bitter hostility. Meetings of protest were held throughout the country.
17818	Thirty-six members of the House of Representatives sought to put on
17819	record their condemnation of the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ act,
17820	only to meet a firm denial by the supporters of the act. Chief Justice
17821	Taney, before whom the case of a man arrested under the President's
17822	military authority was brought, emphatically declared, in a long and
17823	learned opinion bristling with historical examples, that the President
17824	had no power to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_. In Congress and
17825	out, Democrats, abolitionists, and champions of civil liberty denounced
17826	Lincoln and his Cabinet in unsparing terms. Vallandigham, a Democratic
17827	leader of Ohio, afterward banished to the South for his opposition to
17828	the war, constantly applied to Lincoln the epithet of "Caesar." Wendell
17829	Phillips saw in him "a more unlimited despot than the world knows this
17830	side of China."
17831	
17832	Sensitive to such stinging thrusts and no friend of wanton persecution,
17833	Lincoln attempted to mitigate the rigors of the law by paroling many
17834	political prisoners. The general policy, however, he defended in homely
17835	language, very different in tone and meaning from the involved reasoning
17836	of the lawyers. "Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts,
17837	while I must not touch a hair of the wily agitator who induces him to
17838	desert?" he asked in a quiet way of some spokesmen for those who
17839	protested against arresting people for "talking against the war." This
17840	summed up his philosophy. He was engaged in a war to save the union, and
17841	all measures necessary and proper to accomplish that purpose were
17842	warranted by the Constitution which he had sworn to uphold.
17843	
17844	=Military Strategy--North and South.=--The broad outlines of military
17845	strategy followed by the commanders of the opposing forces are clear
17846	even to the layman who cannot be expected to master the details of a
17847	campaign or, for that matter, the maneuvers of a single great battle.
17848	The problem for the South was one of defense mainly, though even for
17849	defense swift and paralyzing strokes at the North were later deemed
17850	imperative measures. The problem of the North was, to put it baldly, one
17851	of invasion and conquest. Southern territory had to be invaded and
17852	Southern armies beaten on their own ground or worn down to exhaustion
17853	there.
17854	
17855	In the execution of this undertaking, geography, as usual, played a
17856	significant part in the disposition of forces. The Appalachian ranges,
17857	stretching through the Confederacy to Northern Alabama, divided the
17858	campaigns into Eastern and Western enterprises. Both were of signal
17859	importance. Victory in the East promised the capture of the Confederate
17860	capital of Richmond, a stroke of moral worth, hardly to be
17861	overestimated. Victory in the West meant severing the Confederacy and
17862	opening the Mississippi Valley down to the Gulf.
17863	
17864	As it turned out, the Western forces accomplished their task first,
17865	vindicating the military powers of union soldiers and shaking the
17866	confidence of opposing commanders. In February, 1862, Grant captured
17867	Fort Donelson on the Tennessee River, rallied wavering unionists in
17868	Kentucky, forced the evacuation of Nashville, and opened the way for two
17869	hundred miles into the Confederacy. At Shiloh, Murfreesboro, Vicksburg,
17870	Chickamauga, Chattanooga, desperate fighting followed and, in spite of
17871	varying fortunes, it resulted in the discomfiture and retirement of
17872	Confederate forces to the Southeast into Georgia. By the middle of 1863,
17873	the Mississippi Valley was open to the Gulf, the initiative taken out of
17874	the hands of Southern commanders in the West, and the way prepared for
17875	Sherman's final stroke--the march from Atlanta to the sea--a maneuver
17876	executed with needless severity in the autumn of 1864.

17881	
17882	For the almost unbroken succession of achievements in the West by
17883	Generals Grant, Sherman, Thomas, and Hooker against Albert Sidney
17884	Johnston, Bragg, Pemberton, and Hood, the union forces in the East
17885	offered at first an almost equally unbroken series of misfortunes and
17886	disasters. Far from capturing Richmond, they had been thrown on the
17887	defensive. General after general--McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, and
17888	Meade--was tried and found wanting. None of them could administer a
17889	crushing defeat to the Confederate troops and more than once the union
17890	soldiers were beaten in a fair battle. They did succeed, however, in
17891	delivering a severe check to advancing Confederates under General Robert
17892	E. Lee, first at Antietam in September, 1862, and then at Gettysburg in
17893	July, 1863--checks reckoned as victories though in each instance the
17894	Confederates escaped without demoralization. Not until the beginning of
17895	the next year, when General Grant, supplied with almost unlimited men
17896	and munitions, began his irresistible hammering at Lee's army, did the
17897	final phase of the war commence. The pitiless drive told at last.
17898	General Lee, on April 9, 1865, seeing the futility of further conflict,
17899	surrendered an army still capable of hard fighting, at Appomattox, not
17900	far from the capital of the Confederacy.

17905	
17906	=Abraham Lincoln.=--The services of Lincoln to the cause of union defy
17907	description. A judicial scrutiny of the war reveals his thought and
17908	planning in every part of the varied activity that finally crowned
17909	Northern arms with victory. Is it in the field of diplomacy? Does
17910	Seward, the Secretary of State, propose harsh and caustic measures
17911	likely to draw England's sword into the scale? Lincoln counsels
17912	moderation. He takes the irritating message and with his own hand
17913	strikes out, erases, tones down, and interlines, exchanging for words
17914	that sting and burn the language of prudence and caution. Is it a matter
17915	of compromise with the South, so often proposed by men on both sides
17916	sick of carnage? Lincoln is always ready to listen and turns away only
17917	when he is invited to surrender principles essential to the safety of
17918	the union. Is it high strategy of war, a question of the general best
17919	fitted to win Gettysburg--Hooker, Sedgwick, or Meade? Lincoln goes in
17920	person to the War Department in the dead of night to take counsel with
17921	his Secretary and to make the fateful choice.
17922	
17923	Is it a complaint from a citizen, deprived, as he believes, of his civil
17924	liberties unjustly or in violation of the Constitution? Lincoln is ready
17925	to hear it and anxious to afford relief, if warrant can be found for it.
17926	Is a mother begging for the life of a son sentenced to be shot as a
17927	deserter? Lincoln hears her petition, and grants it even against the
17928	protests made by his generals in the name of military discipline. Do
17929	politicians sow dissensions in the army and among civilians? Lincoln
17930	grandly waves aside their petty personalities and invites them to think
17931	of the greater cause. Is it a question of securing votes to ratify the
17932	thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery? Lincoln thinks it not beneath
17933	his dignity to traffic and huckster with politicians over the trifling
17934	jobs asked in return by the members who hold out against him. Does a New
17935	York newspaper call him an ignorant Western boor? Lincoln's reply is a
17936	letter to a mother who has given her all--her sons on the field of
17937	battle--and an address at Gettysburg, both of which will live as long as
17938	the tongue in which they were written. These are tributes not only to
17939	his mastery of the English language but also to his mastery of all those
17940	sentiments of sweetness and strength which are the finest flowers of
17941	culture.
17942	
17943	Throughout the entire span of service, however, Lincoln was beset by
17944	merciless critics. The fiery apostles of abolition accused him of
17945	cowardice when he delayed the bold stroke at slavery. Anti-war Democrats
17946	lashed out at every step he took. Even in his own party he found no
17947	peace. Charles Sumner complained: "Our President is now dictator,
17948	_imperator_--whichever you like; but how vain to have the power of a
17949	god and not to use it godlike." Leaders among the Republicans sought to
17950	put him aside in 1864 and place Chase in his chair. "I hope we may never
17951	have a worse man," was Lincoln's quiet answer.
17952	
17953	Wide were the dissensions in the North during that year and the
17954	Republicans, while selecting Lincoln as their candidate again, cast off
17955	their old name and chose the simple title of the "Union party."
17956	Moreover, they selected a Southern man, Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, to
17957	be associated with him as candidate for Vice President. This combination
17958	the Northern Democrats boldly confronted with a platform declaring that
17959	"after four years of failure to restore the union by the experiment of
17960	war, during which, under the pretence of military necessity or war power
17961	higher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself has been
17962	disregarded in every part and public liberty and private right alike
17963	trodden down ... justice, humanity, liberty, and public welfare demand
17964	that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, to the
17965	end that peace may be restored on the basis of the federal union of the
17966	states." It is true that the Democratic candidate, General McClellan,
17967	sought to break the yoke imposed upon him by the platform, saying that
17968	he could not look his old comrades in the face and pronounce their
17969	efforts vain; but the party call to the nation to repudiate Lincoln and
17970	his works had gone forth. The response came, giving Lincoln 2,200,000
17971	votes against 1,800,000 for his opponent. The bitter things said about
17972	him during the campaign, he forgot and forgave. When in April, 1865, he
17973	was struck down by the assassin's hand, he above all others in
17974	Washington was planning measures of moderation and healing.
17975	
17976	
17977	THE RESULTS OF THE CIVIL WAR
17978	
17979	There is a strong and natural tendency on the part of writers to stress
17980	the dramatic and heroic aspects of war; but the long judgment of history
17981	requires us to include all other significant phases as well. Like every
17982	great armed conflict, the Civil War outran the purposes of those who
17983	took part in it. Waged over the nature of the union, it made a
17984	revolution in the union, changing public policies and constitutional
17985	principles and giving a new direction to agriculture and industry.
17986	
17987	=The Supremacy of the Union.=--First and foremost, the war settled for
17988	all time the long dispute as to the nature of the federal system. The
17989	doctrine of state sovereignty was laid to rest. Men might still speak of
17990	the rights of states and think of their commonwealths with affection,
17991	but nullification and secession were destroyed. The nation was supreme.
17992	
17993	=The Destruction of the Slave Power.=--Next to the vindication of
17994	national supremacy was the destruction of the planting aristocracy of
17995	the South--that great power which had furnished leadership of undoubted
17996	ability and had so long contested with the industrial and commercial
17997	interests of the North. The first paralyzing blow at the planters was
17998	struck by the abolition of slavery. The second and third came with the
17999	fourteenth (1868) and fifteenth (1870) amendments, giving the ballot to
18000	freedmen and excluding from public office the Confederate
18001	leaders--driving from the work of reconstruction the finest talents of
18002	the South. As if to add bitterness to gall and wormwood, the fourteenth
18003	amendment forbade the United States or any state to pay any debts
18004	incurred in aid of the Confederacy or in the emancipation of the
18005	slaves--plunging into utter bankruptcy the Southern financiers who had
18006	stripped their section of capital to support their cause. So the
18007	Southern planters found themselves excluded from public office and ruled
18008	over by their former bondmen under the tutelage of Republican leaders.
18009	Their labor system was wrecked and their money and bonds were as
18010	worthless as waste paper. The South was subject to the North. That which
18011	neither the Federalists nor the Whigs had been able to accomplish in the
18012	realm of statecraft was accomplished on the field of battle.
18013	
18014	
18015	=The Triumph of Industry.=--The wreck of the planting system was
18016	accompanied by a mighty upswing of Northern industry which made the old
18017	Whigs of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania stare in wonderment. The demands
18018	of the federal government for manufactured goods at unrestricted prices
18019	gave a stimulus to business which more than replaced the lost markets of
18020	the South. Between 1860 and 1870 the number of manufacturing
18021	establishments increased 79.6 per cent as against 14.2 for the previous
18022	decade; while the number of persons employed almost doubled. There was
18023	no doubt about the future of American industry.
18024	
18025	=The Victory for the Protective Tariff.=--Moreover, it was henceforth to
18026	be well protected. For many years before the war the friends of
18027	protection had been on the defensive. The tariff act of 1857 imposed
18028	duties so low as to presage a tariff for revenue only. The war changed
18029	all that. The extraordinary military expenditures, requiring heavy taxes
18030	on all sources, justified tariffs so high that a follower of Clay or
18031	Webster might well have gasped with astonishment. After the war was over
18032	the debt remained and both interest and principal had to be paid.
18033	Protective arguments based on economic reasoning were supported by a
18034	plain necessity for revenue which admitted no dispute.
18035	
18036	=A Liberal Immigration Policy.=--Linked with industry was the labor
18037	supply. The problem of manning industries became a pressing matter, and
18038	Republican leaders grappled with it. In the platform of the Union party
18039	adopted in 1864 it was declared "that foreign immigration, which in the
18040	past has added so much to the wealth, the development of resources, and
18041	the increase of power to this nation--the asylum of the oppressed of all
18042	nations--should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just
18043	policy." In that very year Congress, recognizing the importance of the
18044	problem, passed a measure of high significance, creating a bureau of
18045	immigration, and authorizing a modified form of indentured labor, by
18046	making it legal for immigrants to pledge their wages in advance to pay
18047	their passage over. Though the bill was soon repealed, the practice
18048	authorized by it was long continued. The cheapness of the passage
18049	shortened the term of service; but the principle was older than the
18050	days of William Penn.
18051	
18052	=The Homestead Act of 1862.=--In the immigration measure guaranteeing a
18053	continuous and adequate labor supply, the manufacturers saw an offset to
18054	the Homestead Act of 1862 granting free lands to settlers. The Homestead
18055	law they had resisted in a long and bitter congressional battle.
18056	Naturally, they had not taken kindly to a scheme which lured men away
18057	from the factories or enabled them to make unlimited demands for higher
18058	wages as the price of remaining. Southern planters likewise had feared
18059	free homesteads for the very good reason that they only promised to add
18060	to the overbalancing power of the North.
18061	
18062	In spite of the opposition, supporters of a liberal land policy made
18063	steady gains. Free-soil Democrats,--Jacksonian farmers and
18064	mechanics,--labor reformers, and political leaders, like Stephen A.
18065	Douglas of Illinois and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, kept up the
18066	agitation in season and out. More than once were they able to force a
18067	homestead bill through the House of Representatives only to have it
18068	blocked in the Senate where Southern interests were intrenched. Then,
18069	after the Senate was won over, a Democratic President, James Buchanan,
18070	vetoed the bill. Still the issue lived. The Republicans, strong among
18071	the farmers of the Northwest, favored it from the beginning and pressed
18072	it upon the attention of the country. Finally the manufacturers yielded;
18073	they received their compensation in the contract labor law. In 1862
18074	Congress provided for the free distribution of land in 160-acre lots
18075	among men and women of strong arms and willing hearts ready to build
18076	their serried lines of homesteads to the Rockies and beyond.
18077	
18078	=Internal Improvements.=--If farmers and manufacturers were early
18079	divided on the matter of free homesteads, the same could hardly be said
18080	of internal improvements. The Western tiller of the soil was as eager
18081	for some easy way of sending his produce to market as the manufacturer
18082	was for the same means to transport his goods to the consumer on the
18083	farm. While the Confederate leaders were writing into their
18084	constitution a clause forbidding all appropriations for internal
18085	improvements, the Republican leaders at Washington were planning such
18086	expenditures from the treasury in the form of public land grants to
18087	railways as would have dazed the authors of the national road bill half
18088	a century earlier.
18089	
18090	=Sound Finance--National Banking.=--From Hamilton's day to Lincoln's,
18091	business men in the East had contended for a sound system of national
18092	currency. The experience of the states with paper money, painfully
18093	impressive in the years before the framing of the Constitution, had been
18094	convincing to those who understood the economy of business. The
18095	Constitution, as we have seen, bore the signs of this experience. States
18096	were forbidden to emit bills of credit: paper money, in short. This
18097	provision stood clear in the document; but judicial ingenuity had
18098	circumvented it in the age of Jacksonian Democracy. The states had
18099	enacted and the Supreme Court, after the death of John Marshall, had
18100	sustained laws chartering banking companies and authorizing them to
18101	issue paper money. So the country was beset by the old curse, the banks
18102	of Western and Southern states issuing reams of paper notes to help
18103	borrowers pay their debts.
18104	
18105	In dealing with war finances, the Republicans attacked this ancient
18106	evil. By act of Congress in 1864, they authorized a series of national
18107	banks founded on the credit of government bonds and empowered to issue
18108	notes. The next year they stopped all bank paper sent forth under the
18109	authority of the states by means of a prohibitive tax. In this way, by
18110	two measures Congress restored federal control over the monetary system
18111	although it did not reestablish the United States Bank so hated by
18112	Jacksonian Democracy.
18113	
18114	=Destruction of States' Rights by Fourteenth Amendment.=--These acts and
18115	others not cited here were measures of centralization and consolidation
18116	at the expense of the powers and dignity of the states. They were all of
18117	high import, but the crowning act of nationalism was the fourteenth
18118	amendment which, among other things, forbade states to "deprive any
18119	person of life, liberty or property without due process of law." The
18120	immediate occasion, though not the actual cause of this provision, was
18121	the need for protecting the rights of freedmen against hostile
18122	legislatures in the South. The result of the amendment, as was
18123	prophesied in protests loud and long from every quarter of the
18124	Democratic party, was the subjection of every act of state, municipal,
18125	and county authorities to possible annulment by the Supreme Court at
18126	Washington. The expected happened.
18127	
18128	Few negroes ever brought cases under the fourteenth amendment to the
18129	attention of the courts; but thousands of state laws, municipal
18130	ordinances, and acts of local authorities were set aside as null and
18131	void under it. Laws of states regulating railway rates, fixing hours of
18132	labor in bakeshops, and taxing corporations were in due time to be
18133	annulled as conflicting with an amendment erroneously supposed to be
18134	designed solely for the protection of negroes. As centralized power over
18135	tariffs, railways, public lands, and other national concerns went to
18136	Congress, so centralized power over the acts of state and local
18137	authorities involving an infringement of personal and property rights
18138	was conferred on the federal judiciary, the apex of which was the
18139	Supreme Court at Washington. Thus the old federation of "independent
18140	states," all equal in rights and dignity, each wearing the "jewel of
18141	sovereignty" so celebrated in Southern oratory, had gone the way of all
18142	flesh under the withering blasts of Civil War.
18143	
18144	
18145	RECONSTRUCTION IN THE SOUTH
18146	
18147	=Theories about the Position of the Seceded States.=--On the morning of
18148	April 9, 1865, when General Lee surrendered his army to General Grant,
18149	eleven states stood in a peculiar relation to the union now declared
18150	perpetual. Lawyers and political philosophers were much perturbed and
18151	had been for some time as to what should be done with the members of the
18152	former Confederacy. Radical Republicans held that they were "conquered
18153	provinces" at the mercy of Congress, to be governed under such laws as
18154	it saw fit to enact and until in its wisdom it decided to readmit any or
18155	all of them to the union. Men of more conservative views held that, as
18156	the war had been waged by the North on the theory that no state could
18157	secede from the union, the Confederate states had merely attempted to
18158	withdraw and had failed. The corollary of this latter line of argument
18159	was simple: "The Southern states are still in the union and it is the
18160	duty of the President, as commander-in-chief, to remove the federal
18161	troops as soon as order is restored and the state governments ready to
18162	function once more as usual."
18163	
18164	=Lincoln's Proposal.=--Some such simple and conservative form of
18165	reconstruction had been suggested by Lincoln in a proclamation of
18166	December 8, 1863. He proposed pardon and a restoration of property,
18167	except in slaves, to nearly all who had "directly or by implication
18168	participated in the existing rebellion," on condition that they take an
18169	oath of loyalty to the union. He then announced that when, in any of the
18170	states named, a body of voters, qualified under the law as it stood
18171	before secession and equal in number to one-tenth the votes cast in
18172	1860, took the oath of allegiance, they should be permitted to
18173	reestablish a state government. Such a government, he added, should be
18174	recognized as a lawful authority and entitled to protection under the
18175	federal Constitution. With reference to the status of the former slaves
18176	Lincoln made it clear that, while their freedom must be recognized, he
18177	would not object to any legislation "which may yet be consistent as a
18178	temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,
18179	landless, and homeless class."
18180	
18181	=Andrew Johnson's Plan--His Impeachment.=--Lincoln's successor, Andrew
18182	Johnson, the Vice President, soon after taking office, proposed to
18183	pursue a somewhat similar course. In a number of states he appointed
18184	military governors, instructing them at the earliest possible moment to
18185	assemble conventions, chosen "by that portion of the people of the said
18186	states who are loyal to the United States," and proceed to the
18187	organization of regular civil government. Johnson, a Southern man and a
18188	Democrat, was immediately charged by the Republicans with being too
18189	ready to restore the Southern states. As the months went by, the
18190	opposition to his measures and policies in Congress grew in size and
18191	bitterness. The contest resulted in the impeachment of Johnson by the
18192	House of Representatives in March, 1868, and his acquittal by the Senate
18193	merely because his opponents lacked one vote of the two-thirds required
18194	for conviction.
18195	
18196	=Congress Enacts "Reconstruction Laws."=--In fact, Congress was in a
18197	strategic position. It was the law-making body, and it could, moreover,
18198	determine the conditions under which Senators and Representatives from
18199	the South were to be readmitted. It therefore proceeded to pass a series
18200	of reconstruction acts--carrying all of them over Johnson's veto. These
18201	measures, the first of which became a law on March 2, 1867, betrayed an
18202	animus not found anywhere in Lincoln's plans or Johnson's proclamations.
18203	
18204	They laid off the ten states--the whole Confederacy with the exception
18205	of Tennessee--still outside the pale, into five military districts, each
18206	commanded by a military officer appointed by the President. They ordered
18207	the commanding general to prepare a register of voters for the election
18208	of delegates to conventions chosen for the purpose of drafting new
18209	constitutions. Such voters, however, were not to be, as Lincoln had
18210	suggested, loyal persons duly qualified under the law existing before
18211	secession but "the male citizens of said state, twenty-one years old and
18212	upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, ... except such
18213	as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony
18214	at common law." This was the death knell to the idea that the leaders of
18215	the Confederacy and their white supporters might be permitted to share
18216	in the establishment of the new order. Power was thus arbitrarily thrust
18217	into the hands of the newly emancipated male negroes and the handful of
18218	whites who could show a record of loyalty. That was not all. Each state
18219	was, under the reconstruction acts, compelled to ratify the fourteenth
18220	amendment to the federal Constitution as a price of restoration to the
18221	union.
18222	
18223	The composition of the conventions thus authorized may be imagined.
18224	Bondmen without the asking and without preparation found themselves the
18225	governing power. An army of adventurers from the North, "carpet baggers"
18226	as they were called, poured in upon the scene to aid in
18227	"reconstruction." Undoubtedly many men of honor and fine intentions gave
18228	unstinted service, but the results of their deliberations only
18229	aggravated the open wound left by the war. Any number of political
18230	doctors offered their prescriptions; but no effective remedy could be
18231	found. Under measures admittedly open to grave objections, the Southern
18232	states were one after another restored to the union by the grace of
18233	Congress, the last one in 1870. Even this grudging concession of the
18234	formalities of statehood did not mean a full restoration of honors and
18235	privileges. The last soldier was not withdrawn from the last Southern
18236	capital until 1877, and federal control over elections long remained as
18237	a sign of congressional supremacy.
18238	
18239	=The Status of the Freedmen.=--Even more intricate than the issues
18240	involved in restoring the seceded states to the union was the question
18241	of what to do with the newly emancipated slaves. That problem, often put
18242	to abolitionists before the war, had become at last a real concern. The
18243	thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery had not touched it at all. It
18244	declared bondmen free, but did nothing to provide them with work or
18245	homes and did not mention the subject of political rights. All these
18246	matters were left to the states, and the legislatures of some of them,
18247	by their famous "black codes," restored a form of servitude under the
18248	guise of vagrancy and apprentice laws. Such methods were in fact partly
18249	responsible for the reaction that led Congress to abandon Lincoln's
18250	policies and undertake its own program of reconstruction.
18251	
18252	Still no extensive effort was made to solve by law the economic problems
18253	of the bondmen. Radical abolitionists had advocated that the slaves when
18254	emancipated should be given outright the fields of their former
18255	masters; but Congress steadily rejected the very idea of confiscation.
18256	The necessity of immediate assistance it recognized by creating in 1865
18257	the Freedmen's Bureau to take care of refugees. It authorized the issue
18258	of food and clothing to the destitute and the renting of abandoned and
18259	certain other lands under federal control to former slaves at reasonable
18260	rates. But the larger problem of the relation of the freedmen to the
18261	land, it left to the slow working of time.
18262	
18263	Against sharp protests from conservative men, particularly among the
18264	Democrats, Congress did insist, however, on conferring upon the freedmen
18265	certain rights by national law. These rights fell into broad divisions,
18266	civil and political. By an act passed in 1866, Congress gave to former
18267	slaves the rights of white citizens in the matter of making contracts,
18268	giving testimony in courts, and purchasing, selling, and leasing
18269	property. As it was doubtful whether Congress had the power to enact
18270	this law, there was passed and submitted to the states the fourteenth
18271	amendment which gave citizenship to the freedmen, assured them of the
18272	privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and declared
18273	that no state should deprive any person of his life, liberty, or
18274	property without due process of law. Not yet satisfied, Congress
18275	attempted to give social equality to negroes by the second civil rights
18276	bill of 1875 which promised to them, among other things, the full and
18277	equal enjoyment of inns, theaters, public conveyances, and places of
18278	amusement--a law later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
18279	
18280	The matter of political rights was even more hotly contested; but the
18281	radical Republicans, like Charles Sumner, asserted that civil rights
18282	were not secure unless supported by the suffrage. In this same
18283	fourteenth amendment they attempted to guarantee the ballot to all negro
18284	men, leaving the women to take care of themselves. The amendment
18285	declared in effect that when any state deprived adult male citizens of
18286	the right to vote, its representation in Congress should be reduced in
18287	the proportion such persons bore to the voting population.
18288	
18289	This provision having failed to accomplish its purpose, the fifteenth
18290	amendment was passed and ratified, expressly declaring that no citizen
18291	should be deprived of the right to vote "on account of race, color, or
18292	previous condition of servitude." To make assurance doubly secure,
18293	Congress enacted in 1870, 1872, and 1873 three drastic laws, sometimes
18294	known as "force bills," providing for the use of federal authorities,
18295	civil and military, in supervising elections in all parts of the Union.
18296	So the federal government, having destroyed chattel slavery, sought by
18297	legal decree to sweep away all its signs and badges, civil, social, and
18298	political. Never, save perhaps in some of the civil conflicts of Greece
18299	or Rome, had there occurred in the affairs of a nation a social
18300	revolution so complete, so drastic, and far-reaching in its results.
18301	
18302	
18303	SUMMARY OF THE SECTIONAL CONFLICT
18304	
18305	Just as the United States, under the impetus of Western enterprise,
18306	rounded out the continental domain, its very existence as a nation was
18307	challenged by a fratricidal conflict between two sections. This storm
18308	had been long gathering upon the horizon. From the very beginning in
18309	colonial times there had been a marked difference between the South and
18310	the North. The former by climate and soil was dedicated to a planting
18311	system--the cultivation of tobacco, rice, cotton, and sugar cane--and in
18312	the course of time slave labor became the foundation of the system. The
18313	North, on the other hand, supplemented agriculture by commerce, trade,
18314	and manufacturing. Slavery, though lawful, did not flourish there. An
18315	abundant supply of free labor kept the Northern wheels turning.
18316	
18317	This difference between the two sections, early noted by close
18318	observers, was increased with the advent of the steam engine and the
18319	factory system. Between 1815 and 1860 an industrial revolution took
18320	place in the North. Its signs were gigantic factories, huge aggregations
18321	of industrial workers, immense cities, a flourishing commerce, and
18322	prosperous banks. Finding an unfavorable reception in the South, the new
18323	industrial system was confined mainly to the North. By canals and
18324	railways New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were linked with the
18325	wheatfields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. A steel net wove North and
18326	Northwest together. A commercial net supplemented it. Western trade was
18327	diverted from New Orleans to the East and Eastern credit sustained
18328	Western enterprise.
18329	
18330	In time, the industrial North and the planting South evolved different
18331	ideas of political policy. The former looked with favor on protective
18332	tariffs, ship subsidies, a sound national banking system, and internal
18333	improvements. The farmers of the West demanded that the public domain be
18334	divided up into free homesteads for farmers. The South steadily swung
18335	around to the opposite view. Its spokesmen came to regard most of these
18336	policies as injurious to the planting interests.
18337	
18338	The economic questions were all involved in a moral issue. The Northern
18339	states, in which slavery was of slight consequence, had early abolished
18340	the institution. In the course of a few years there appeared
18341	uncompromising advocates of universal emancipation. Far and wide the
18342	agitation spread. The South was thoroughly frightened. It demanded
18343	protection against the agitators, the enforcement of its rights in the
18344	case of runaway slaves, and equal privileges for slavery in the new
18345	territories.
18346	
18347	With the passing years the conflict between the two sections increased
18348	in bitterness. It flamed up in 1820 and was allayed by the Missouri
18349	compromise. It took on the form of a tariff controversy and
18350	nullification in 1832. It appeared again after the Mexican war when the
18351	question of slavery in the new territories was raised. Again
18352	compromise--the great settlement of 1850--seemed to restore peace, only
18353	to prove an illusion. A series of startling events swept the country
18354	into war: the repeal of the Missouri compromise in 1854, the rise of the
18355	Republican party pledged to the prohibition of slavery in the
18356	territories, the Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Lincoln-Douglas
18357	debates, John Brown's raid, the election of Lincoln, and secession.
18358	
18359	The Civil War, lasting for four years, tested the strength of both North
18360	and South, in leadership, in finance, in diplomatic skill, in material
18361	resources, in industry, and in armed forces. By the blockade of Southern
18362	ports, by an overwhelming weight of men and materials, and by relentless
18363	hammering on the field of battle, the North was victorious.
18364	
18365	The results of the war were revolutionary in character. Slavery was
18366	abolished and the freedmen given the ballot. The Southern planters who
18367	had been the leaders of their section were ruined financially and almost
18368	to a man excluded from taking part in political affairs. The union was
18369	declared to be perpetual and the right of a state to secede settled by
18370	the judgment of battle. Federal control over the affairs of states,
18371	counties, and cities was established by the fourteenth amendment. The
18372	power and prestige of the federal government were enhanced beyond
18373	imagination. The North was now free to pursue its economic policies: a
18374	protective tariff, a national banking system, land grants for railways,
18375	free lands for farmers. Planting had dominated the country for nearly a
18376	generation. Business enterprise was to take its place.

18493	
18494	THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EVOLUTION OF THE SOUTH
18495	
18496	
18497	The outcome of the Civil War in the South was nothing short of a
18498	revolution. The ruling class, the law, and the government of the old
18499	order had been subverted. To political chaos was added the havoc wrought
18500	in agriculture, business, and transportation by military operations. And
18501	as if to fill the cup to the brim, the task of reconstruction was
18502	committed to political leaders from another section of the country,
18503	strangers to the life and traditions of the South.
18504	
18505	
18506	THE SOUTH AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR
18507	
18508	=A Ruling Class Disfranchised.=--As the sovereignty of the planters had
18509	been the striking feature of the old regime, so their ruin was the
18510	outstanding fact of the new. The situation was extraordinary. The
18511	American Revolution was carried out by people experienced in the arts of
18512	self-government, and at its close they were free to follow the general
18513	course to which they had long been accustomed. The French Revolution
18514	witnessed the overthrow of the clergy and the nobility; but middle
18515	classes who took their places had been steadily rising in intelligence
18516	and wealth.
18517	
18518	The Southern Revolution was unlike either of these cataclysms. It was
18519	not brought about by a social upheaval, but by an external crisis. It
18520	did not enfranchise a class that sought and understood power, but
18521	bondmen who had played no part in the struggle. Moreover it struck down
18522	a class equipped to rule. The leading planters were almost to a man
18523	excluded from state and federal offices, and the fourteenth amendment
18524	was a bar to their return. All civil and military places under the
18525	authority of the United States and of the states were closed to every
18526	man who had taken an oath to support the Constitution as a member of
18527	Congress, as a state legislator, or as a state or federal officer, and
18528	afterward engaged in "insurrection or rebellion," or "given aid and
18529	comfort to the enemies" of the United States. This sweeping provision,
18530	supplemented by the reconstruction acts, laid under the ban most of the
18531	talent, energy, and spirit of the South.
18532	
18533	=The Condition of the State Governments.=--The legislative, executive,
18534	and judicial branches of the state governments thus passed into the
18535	control of former slaves, led principally by Northern adventurers or
18536	Southern novices, known as "Scalawags." The result was a carnival of
18537	waste, folly, and corruption. The "reconstruction" assembly of South
18538	Carolina bought clocks at $480 apiece and chandeliers at $650. To
18539	purchase land for former bondmen the sum of $800,000 was appropriated;
18540	and swamps bought at seventy-five cents an acre were sold to the state
18541	at five times the cost. In the years between 1868 and 1873, the debt of
18542	the state rose from about $5,800,000 to $24,000,000, and millions of the
18543	increase could not be accounted for by the authorities responsible for
18544	it.
18545	
18546	=Economic Ruin--Urban and Rural.=--No matter where Southern men turned
18547	in 1865 they found devastation--in the towns, in the country, and along
18548	the highways. Atlanta, the city to which Sherman applied the torch, lay
18549	in ashes; Nashville and Chattanooga had been partially wrecked; Richmond
18550	and Augusta had suffered severely from fires. Charleston was described
18551	by a visitor as "a city of ruins, of desolation, of vacant houses, of
18552	rotten wharves, of deserted warehouses, of weed gardens, of miles of
18553	grass-grown streets.... How few young men there are, how generally the
18554	young women are dressed in black! The flower of their proud aristocracy
18555	is buried on scores of battle fields."
18556	
18557	Those who journeyed through the country about the same time reported
18558	desolation equally widespread and equally pathetic. An English traveler
18559	who made his way along the course of the Tennessee River in 1870 wrote:
18560	"The trail of war is visible throughout the valley in burnt-up gin
18561	houses, ruined bridges, mills, and factories ... and large tracts of
18562	once cultivated land are stripped of every vestige of fencing. The
18563	roads, long neglected, are in disorder and, having in many places become
18564	impassable, new tracks have been made through the woods and fields
18565	without much respect to boundaries." Many a great plantation had been
18566	confiscated by the federal authorities while the owner was in
18567	Confederate service. Many more lay in waste. In the wake of the armies
18568	the homes of rich and poor alike, if spared the torch, had been
18569	despoiled of the stock and seeds necessary to renew agriculture.
18570	
18571	=Railways Dilapidated.=--Transportation was still more demoralized. This
18572	is revealed in the pages of congressional reports based upon first-hand
18573	investigations. One eloquent passage illustrates all the rest. From
18574	Pocahontas to Decatur, Alabama, a distance of 114 miles, we are told,
18575	the railroad was "almost entirely destroyed, except the road bed and
18576	iron rails, and they were in a very bad condition--every bridge and
18577	trestle destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water tanks
18578	gone, tracks grown up in weeds and bushes, not a saw mill near the line
18579	and the labor system of the country gone. About forty miles of the track
18580	were burned, the cross-ties entirely destroyed, and the rails bent and
18581	twisted in such a manner as to require great labor to straighten and a
18582	large portion of them requiring renewal."
18583	
18584	=Capital and Credit Destroyed.=--The fluid capital of the South, money
18585	and credit, was in the same prostrate condition as the material capital.
18586	The Confederate currency, inflated to the bursting point, had utterly
18587	collapsed and was as worthless as waste paper. The bonds of the
18588	Confederate government were equally valueless. Specie had nearly
18589	disappeared from circulation. The fourteenth amendment to the federal
18590	Constitution had made all "debts, obligations, and claims" incurred in
18591	aid of the Confederate cause "illegal and void." Millions of dollars
18592	owed to Northern creditors before the war were overdue and payment was
18593	pressed upon the debtors. Where such debts were secured by mortgages on
18594	land, executions against the property could be obtained in federal
18595	courts.
18596	
18597	
18598	THE RESTORATION OF WHITE SUPREMACY
18599	
18600	=Intimidation.=--In both politics and economics, the process of
18601	reconstruction in the South was slow and arduous. The first battle in
18602	the political contest for white supremacy was won outside the halls of
18603	legislatures and the courts of law. It was waged, in the main, by secret
18604	organizations, among which the Ku Klux Klan and the White Camelia were
18605	the most prominent. The first of these societies appeared in Tennessee
18606	in 1866 and held its first national convention the following year. It
18607	was in origin a social club. According to its announcement, its objects
18608	were "to protect the weak, the innocent, and the defenceless from the
18609	indignities, wrongs, and outrages of the lawless, the violent, and the
18610	brutal; and to succor the suffering, especially the widows and orphans
18611	of the Confederate soldiers." The whole South was called "the Empire"
18612	and was ruled by a "Grand Wizard." Each state was a realm and each
18613	county a province. In the secret orders there were enrolled over half a
18614	million men.
18615	
18616	The methods of the Ku Klux and the White Camelia were similar. Solemn
18617	parades of masked men on horses decked in long robes were held,
18618	sometimes in the daytime and sometimes at the dead of night. Notices
18619	were sent to obnoxious persons warning them to stop certain practices.
18620	If warning failed, something more convincing was tried. Fright was the
18621	emotion most commonly stirred. A horseman, at the witching hour of
18622	midnight, would ride up to the house of some offender, lift his head
18623	gear, take off a skull, and hand it to the trembling victim with the
18624	request that he hold it for a few minutes. Frequently violence was
18625	employed either officially or unofficially by members of the Klan. Tar
18626	and feathers were freely applied; the whip was sometimes laid on
18627	unmercifully, and occasionally a brutal murder was committed. Often the
18628	members were fired upon from bushes or behind trees, and swift
18629	retaliation followed. So alarming did the clashes become that in 1870
18630	Congress forbade interference with electors or going in disguise for the
18631	purpose of obstructing the exercise of the rights enjoyed under federal
18632	law.
18633	
18634	In anticipation of such a step on the part of the federal government,
18635	the Ku Klux was officially dissolved by the "Grand Wizard" in 1869.
18636	Nevertheless, the local societies continued their organization and
18637	methods. The spirit survived the national association. "On the whole,"
18638	says a Southern writer, "it is not easy to see what other course was
18639	open to the South.... Armed resistance was out of the question. And yet
18640	there must be some control had of the situation.... If force was denied,
18641	craft was inevitable."
18642	
18643	=The Struggle for the Ballot Box.=--The effects of intimidation were
18644	soon seen at elections. The freedman, into whose inexperienced hand the
18645	ballot had been thrust, was ordinarily loath to risk his head by the
18646	exercise of his new rights. He had not attained them by a long and
18647	laborious contest of his own and he saw no urgent reason why he should
18648	battle for the privilege of using them. The mere show of force, the mere
18649	existence of a threat, deterred thousands of ex-slaves from appearing at
18650	the polls. Thus the whites steadily recovered their dominance. Nothing
18651	could prevent it. Congress enacted force bills establishing federal
18652	supervision of elections and the Northern politicians protested against
18653	the return of former Confederates to practical, if not official, power;
18654	but all such opposition was like resistance to the course of nature.
18655	
18656	=Amnesty for Southerners.=--The recovery of white supremacy in this way
18657	was quickly felt in national councils. The Democratic party in the North
18658	welcomed it as a sign of its return to power. The more moderate
18659	Republicans, anxious to heal the breach in American unity, sought to
18660	encourage rather than to repress it. So it came about that amnesty for
18661	Confederates was widely advocated. Yet it must be said that the struggle
18662	for the removal of disabilities was stubborn and bitter. Lincoln, with
18663	characteristic generosity, in the midst of the war had issued a general
18664	proclamation of amnesty to nearly all who had been in arms against the
18665	Union, on condition that they take an oath of loyalty; but Johnson,
18666	vindictive toward Southern leaders and determined to make "treason
18667	infamous," had extended the list of exceptions. Congress, even more
18668	relentless in its pursuit of Confederates, pushed through the fourteenth
18669	amendment which worked the sweeping disabilities we have just described.
18670	
18671	To appeals for comprehensive clemency, Congress was at first adamant. In
18672	vain did men like Carl Schurz exhort their colleagues to crown their
18673	victory in battle with a noble act of universal pardon and oblivion.
18674	Congress would not yield. It would grant amnesty in individual cases;
18675	for the principle of proscription it stood fast. When finally in 1872,
18676	seven years after the surrender at Appomattox, it did pass the general
18677	amnesty bill, it insisted on certain exceptions. Confederates who had
18678	been members of Congress just before the war, or had served in other
18679	high posts, civil or military, under the federal government, were still
18680	excluded from important offices. Not until the summer of 1898, when the
18681	war with Spain produced once more a union of hearts, did Congress relent
18682	and abolish the last of the disabilities imposed on the Confederates.
18683	
18684	=The Force Bills Attacked and Nullified.=--The granting of amnesty
18685	encouraged the Democrats to redouble their efforts all along the line.
18686	In 1874 they captured the House of Representatives and declared war on
18687	the "force bills." As a Republican Senate blocked immediate repeal, they
18688	resorted to an ingenious parliamentary trick. To the appropriation bill
18689	for the support of the army they attached a "rider," or condition, to
18690	the effect that no troops should be used to sustain the Republican
18691	government in Louisiana. The Senate rejected the proposal. A deadlock
18692	ensued and Congress adjourned without making provision for the army.
18693	Satisfied with the technical victory, the Democrats let the army bill
18694	pass the next session, but kept up their fight on the force laws until
18695	they wrung from President Hayes a measure forbidding the use of United
18696	States troops in supervising elections. The following year they again
18697	had recourse to a rider on the army bill and carried it through, putting
18698	an end to the use of money for military control of elections. The
18699	reconstruction program was clearly going to pieces, and the Supreme
18700	Court helped along the process of dissolution by declaring parts of the
18701	laws invalid. In 1878 the Democrats even won a majority in the Senate
18702	and returned to power a large number of men once prominent in the
18703	Confederate cause.
18704	
18705	The passions of the war by this time were evidently cooling. A new
18706	generation of men was coming on the scene. The supremacy of the whites
18707	in the South, if not yet complete, was at least assured. Federal
18708	marshals, their deputies, and supervisors of elections still possessed
18709	authority over the polls, but their strength had been shorn by the
18710	withdrawal of United States troops. The war on the remaining remnants of
18711	the "force bills" lapsed into desultory skirmishing. When in 1894 the
18712	last fragment was swept away, the country took little note of the fact.
18713	The only task that lay before the Southern leaders was to write in the
18714	constitutions of their respective states the provisions of law which
18715	would clinch the gains so far secured and establish white supremacy
18716	beyond the reach of outside intervention.
18717	
18718	=White Supremacy Sealed by New State Constitutions.=--The impetus to
18719	this final step was given by the rise of the Populist movement in the
18720	South, which sharply divided the whites and in many communities threw
18721	the balance of power into the hands of the few colored voters who
18722	survived the process of intimidation. Southern leaders now devised new
18723	constitutions so constructed as to deprive negroes of the ballot by law.
18724	Mississippi took the lead in 1890; South Carolina followed five years
18725	later; Louisiana, in 1898; North Carolina, in 1900; Alabama and
18726	Maryland, in 1901; and Virginia, in 1902.
18727	
18728	The authors of these measures made no attempt to conceal their purposes.
18729	"The intelligent white men of the South," said Governor Tillman, "intend
18730	to govern here." The fifteenth amendment to the federal Constitution,
18731	however, forbade them to deprive any citizen of the right to vote on
18732	account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This made
18733	necessary the devices of indirection. They were few, simple, and
18734	effective. The first and most easily administered was the ingenious
18735	provision requiring each prospective voter to read a section of the
18736	state constitution or "understand and explain it" when read to him by
18737	the election officers. As an alternative, the payment of taxes or the
18738	ownership of a small amount of property was accepted as a qualification
18739	for voting. Southern leaders, unwilling to disfranchise any of the poor
18740	white men who had stood side by side with them "in the dark days of
18741	reconstruction," also resorted to a famous provision known as "the
18742	grandfather clause." This plan admitted to the suffrage any man who did
18743	not have either property or educational qualifications, provided he had
18744	voted on or before 1867 or was the son or grandson of any such person.
18745	
18746	The devices worked effectively. Of the 147,000 negroes in Mississippi
18747	above the age of twenty-one, only about 8600 registered under the
18748	constitution of 1890. Louisiana had 127,000 colored voters enrolled in
18749	1896; under the constitution drafted two years later the registration
18750	fell to 5300. An analysis of the figures for South Carolina in 1900
18751	indicates that only about one negro out of every hundred adult males of
18752	that race took part in elections. Thus was closed this chapter of
18753	reconstruction.
18754	
18755	=The Supreme Court Refuses to Intervene.=--Numerous efforts were made to
18756	prevail upon the Supreme Court of the United States to declare such laws
18757	unconstitutional; but the Court, usually on technical grounds, avoided
18758	coming to a direct decision on the merits of the matter. In one case
18759	the Court remarked that it could not take charge of and operate the
18760	election machinery of Alabama; it concluded that "relief from a great
18761	political wrong, if done as alleged, by the people of a state and by the
18762	state itself, must be given by them, or by the legislative and executive
18763	departments of the government of the United States." Only one of the
18764	several schemes employed, namely, the "grandfather clause," was held to
18765	be a violation of the federal Constitution. This blow, effected in 1915
18766	by the decision in the Oklahoma and Maryland cases, left, however, the
18767	main structure of disfranchisement unimpaired.
18768	
18769	=Proposals to Reduce Southern Representation in Congress.=--These
18770	provisions excluding thousands of male citizens from the ballot did not,
18771	in express terms, deprive any one of the vote on account of race or
18772	color. They did not, therefore, run counter to the letter of the
18773	fifteenth amendment; but they did unquestionably make the states which
18774	adopted them liable to the operations of the fourteenth amendment. The
18775	latter very explicitly provides that whenever any state deprives adult
18776	male citizens of the right to vote (except in certain minor cases) the
18777	representation of the state in Congress shall be reduced in the
18778	proportion which such number of disfranchised citizens bears to the
18779	whole number of male citizens over twenty-one years of age.
18780	
18781	Mindful of this provision, those who protested against disfranchisement
18782	in the South turned to the Republican party for relief, asking for
18783	action by the political branches of the federal government as the
18784	Supreme Court had suggested. The Republicans responded in their platform
18785	of 1908 by condemning all devices designed to deprive any one of the
18786	ballot for reasons of color alone; they demanded the enforcement in
18787	letter and spirit of the fourteenth as well as all other amendments.
18788	Though victorious in the election, the Republicans refrained from
18789	reopening the ancient contest; they made no attempt to reduce Southern
18790	representation in the House. Southern leaders, while protesting against
18791	the declarations of their opponents, were able to view them as idle
18792	threats in no way endangering the security of the measures by which
18793	political reconstruction had been undone.
18794	
18795	=The Solid South.=--Out of the thirty-year conflict against "carpet-bag
18796	rule" there emerged what was long known as the "solid South"--a South
18797	that, except occasionally in the border states, never gave an electoral
18798	vote to a Republican candidate for President. Before the Civil War, the
18799	Southern people had been divided on political questions. Take, for
18800	example, the election of 1860. In all the fifteen slave states the
18801	variety of opinion was marked. In nine of them--Delaware, Virginia,
18802	Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and
18803	Arkansas--the combined vote against the representative of the extreme
18804	Southern point of view, Breckinridge, constituted a safe majority. In
18805	each of the six states which were carried by Breckinridge, there was a
18806	large and powerful minority. In North Carolina Breckinridge's majority
18807	over Bell and Douglas was only 849 votes. Equally astounding to those
18808	who imagine the South united in defense of extreme views in 1860 was the
18809	vote for Bell, the Unionist candidate, who stood firmly for the
18810	Constitution and silence on slavery. In every Southern state Bell's vote
18811	was large. In Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee it was greater
18812	than that received by Breckinridge; in Georgia, it was 42,000 against
18813	51,000; in Louisiana, 20,000 against 22,000; in Mississippi, 25,000
18814	against 40,000.
18815	
18816	The effect of the Civil War upon these divisions was immediate and
18817	decisive, save in the border states where thousands of men continued to
18818	adhere to the cause of Union. In the Confederacy itself nearly all
18819	dissent was silenced by war. Men who had been bitter opponents joined
18820	hands in defense of their homes; when the armed conflict was over they
18821	remained side by side working against "Republican misrule and negro
18822	domination." By 1890, after Northern supremacy was definitely broken,
18823	they boasted that there were at least twelve Southern states in which no
18824	Republican candidate for President could win a single electoral vote.
18825	
18826	=Dissent in the Solid South.=--Though every one grew accustomed to speak
18827	of the South as "solid," it did not escape close observers that in a
18828	number of Southern states there appeared from time to time a fairly
18829	large body of dissenters. In 1892 the Populists made heavy inroads upon
18830	the Democratic ranks. On other occasions, the contests between factions
18831	within the Democratic party over the nomination of candidates revealed
18832	sharp differences of opinion. In some places, moreover, there grew up a
18833	Republican minority of respectable size. For example, in Georgia, Mr.
18834	Taft in 1908 polled 41,000 votes against 72,000 for Mr. Bryan; in North
18835	Carolina, 114,000 against 136,000; in Tennessee, 118,000 against
18836	135,000; in Kentucky, 235,000 against 244,000. In 1920, Senator Harding,
18837	the Republican candidate, broke the record by carrying Tennessee as well
18838	as Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Maryland.
18839	
18840	
18841	THE ECONOMIC ADVANCE OF THE SOUTH
18842	
18843	=The Break-up of the Great Estates.=--In the dissolution of chattel
18844	slavery it was inevitable that the great estate should give way before
18845	the small farm. The plantation was in fact founded on slavery. It was
18846	continued and expanded by slavery. Before the war the prosperous
18847	planter, either by inclination or necessity, invested his surplus in
18848	more land to add to his original domain. As his slaves increased in
18849	number, he was forced to increase his acreage or sell them, and he
18850	usually preferred the former, especially in the Far South. Still another
18851	element favored the large estate. Slave labor quickly exhausted the soil
18852	and of its own force compelled the cutting of the forests and the
18853	extension of the area under cultivation. Finally, the planter took a
18854	natural pride in his great estate; it was a sign of his prowess and his
18855	social prestige.
18856	
18857	In 1865 the foundations of the planting system were gone. It was
18858	difficult to get efficient labor to till the vast plantations. The
18859	planters themselves were burdened with debts and handicapped by lack of
18860	capital. Negroes commonly preferred tilling plots of their own, rented
18861	or bought under mortgage, to the more irksome wage labor under white
18862	supervision. The land hunger of the white farmer, once checked by the
18863	planting system, reasserted itself. Before these forces the plantation
18864	broke up. The small farm became the unit of cultivation in the South as
18865	in the North. Between 1870 and 1900 the number of farms doubled in every
18866	state south of the line of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, except in
18867	Arkansas and Louisiana. From year to year the process of breaking up
18868	continued, with all that it implied in the creation of land-owning
18869	farmers.
18870	
18871	=The Diversification of Crops.=--No less significant was the concurrent
18872	diversification of crops. Under slavery, tobacco, rice, and sugar were
18873	staples and "cotton was king." These were standard crops. The methods of
18874	cultivation were simple and easily learned. They tested neither the
18875	skill nor the ingenuity of the slaves. As the returns were quick, they
18876	did not call for long-time investments of capital. After slavery was
18877	abolished, they still remained the staples, but far-sighted
18878	agriculturists saw the dangers of depending upon a few crops. The mild
18879	climate all the way around the coast from Virginia to Texas and the
18880	character of the alluvial soil invited the exercise of more imagination.
18881	Peaches, oranges, peanuts, and other fruits and vegetables were found to
18882	grow luxuriantly. Refrigeration for steamships and freight cars put the
18883	markets of great cities at the doors of Southern fruit and vegetable
18884	gardeners. The South, which in planting days had relied so heavily upon
18885	the Northwest for its foodstuffs, began to battle for independence.
18886	Between 1880 and the close of the century the value of its farm crops
18887	increased from $660,000,000 to $1,270,000,000.
18888	
18889	=The Industrial and Commercial Revolution.=--On top of the radical
18890	changes in agriculture came an industrial and commercial revolution. The
18891	South had long been rich in natural resources, but the slave system had
18892	been unfavorable to their development. Rivers that would have turned
18893	millions of spindles tumbled unheeded to the seas. Coal and iron beds
18894	lay unopened. Timber was largely sacrificed in clearing lands for
18895	planting, or fell to earth in decay. Southern enterprise was consumed in
18896	planting. Slavery kept out the white immigrants who might have supplied
18897	the skilled labor for industry.

18901	STEEL MILLS--BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA]
18902	
18903	After 1865, achievement and fortune no longer lay on the land alone. As
18904	soon as the paralysis of the war was over, the South caught the
18905	industrial spirit that had conquered feudal Europe and the agricultural
18906	North. In the development of mineral wealth, enormous strides were
18907	taken. Iron ore of every quality was found, the chief beds being in
18908	Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia,
18909	Alabama, Arkansas, and Texas. Five important coal basins were uncovered:
18910	in Virginia, North Carolina, the Appalachian chain from Maryland to
18911	Northern Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas. Oil pools were found
18912	in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. Within two decades, 1880 to 1900, the
18913	output of mineral wealth multiplied tenfold: from ten millions a year to
18914	one hundred millions. The iron industries of West Virginia and Alabama
18915	began to rival those of Pennsylvania. Birmingham became the Pittsburgh
18916	and Atlanta the Chicago of the South.
18917

18919	
18920	A SOUTHERN COTTON MILL IN A COTTON FIELD]
18921	
18922	In other lines of industry, lumbering and cotton manufacturing took a
18923	high rank. The development of Southern timber resources was in every
18924	respect remarkable, particularly in Louisiana, Arkansas, and
18925	Mississippi. At the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,
18926	primacy in lumber had passed from the Great Lakes region to the South.
18927	In 1913 eight Southern states produced nearly four times as much lumber
18928	as the Lake states and twice as much as the vast forests of Washington
18929	and Oregon.
18930	
18931	The development of the cotton industry, in the meantime, was similarly
18932	astounding. In 1865 cotton spinning was a negligible matter in the
18933	Southern states. In 1880 they had one-fourth of the mills of the
18934	country. At the end of the century they had one-half the mills, the two
18935	Carolinas taking the lead by consuming more than one-third of their
18936	entire cotton crop. Having both the raw materials and the power at hand,
18937	they enjoyed many advantages over the New England rivals, and at the
18938	opening of the new century were outstripping the latter in the
18939	proportion of spindles annually put into operation. Moreover, the cotton
18940	planters, finding a market at the neighboring mills, began to look
18941	forward to a day when they would be somewhat emancipated from absolute
18942	dependence upon the cotton exchanges of New York, New Orleans, and
18943	Liverpool.
18944	
18945	Transportation kept pace with industry. In 1860, the South had about ten
18946	thousand miles of railway. By 1880 the figure had doubled. During the
18947	next twenty years over thirty thousand miles were added, most of the
18948	increase being in Texas. About 1898 there opened a period of
18949	consolidation in which scores of short lines were united, mainly under
18950	the leadership of Northern capitalists, and new through service opened
18951	to the North and West. Thus Southern industries were given easy outlets
18952	to the markets of the nation and brought within the main currents of
18953	national business enterprise.
18954	
18955	=The Social Effects of the Economic Changes.=--As long as the slave
18956	system lasted and planting was the major interest, the South was bound
18957	to be sectional in character. With slavery gone, crops diversified,
18958	natural resources developed, and industries promoted, the social order
18959	of the ante-bellum days inevitably dissolved; the South became more and
18960	more assimilated to the system of the North. In this process several
18961	lines of development are evident.
18962	
18963	In the first place we see the steady rise of the small farmer. Even in
18964	the old days there had been a large class of white yeomen who owned no
18965	slaves and tilled the soil with their own hands, but they labored under
18966	severe handicaps. They found the fertile lands of the coast and river
18967	valleys nearly all monopolized by planters, and they were by the force
18968	of circumstances driven into the uplands where the soil was thin and the
18969	crops were light. Still they increased in numbers and zealously worked
18970	their freeholds.
18971	
18972	The war proved to be their opportunity. With the break-up of the
18973	plantations, they managed to buy land more worthy of their plows. By
18974	intelligent labor and intensive cultivation they were able to restore
18975	much of the worn-out soil to its original fertility. In the meantime
18976	they rose with their prosperity in the social and political scale. It
18977	became common for the sons of white farmers to enter the professions,
18978	while their daughters went away to college and prepared for teaching.
18979	Thus a more democratic tone was given to the white society of the South.
18980	Moreover the migration to the North and West, which had formerly carried
18981	thousands of energetic sons and daughters to search for new homesteads,
18982	was materially reduced. The energy of the agricultural population went
18983	into rehabilitation.
18984	
18985	The increase in the number of independent farmers was accompanied by the
18986	rise of small towns and villages which gave diversity to the life of the
18987	South. Before 1860 it was possible to travel through endless stretches
18988	of cotton and tobacco. The social affairs of the planter's family
18989	centered in the homestead even if they were occasionally interrupted by
18990	trips to distant cities or abroad. Carpentry, bricklaying, and
18991	blacksmithing were usually done by slaves skilled in simple handicrafts.
18992	Supplies were bought wholesale. In this way there was little place in
18993	plantation economy for villages and towns with their stores and
18994	mechanics.
18995	
18996	The abolition of slavery altered this. Small farms spread out where
18997	plantations had once stood. The skilled freedmen turned to agriculture
18998	rather than to handicrafts; white men of a business or mechanical bent
18999	found an opportunity to serve the needs of their communities. So local
19000	merchants and mechanics became an important element in the social
19001	system. In the county seats, once dominated by the planters, business
19002	and professional men assumed the leadership.
19003	
19004	Another vital outcome of this revolution was the transference of a large
19005	part of planting enterprise to business. Mr. Bruce, a Southern historian
19006	of fine scholarship, has summed up this process in a single telling
19007	paragraph: "The higher planting class that under the old system gave so
19008	much distinction to rural life has, so far as it has survived at all,
19009	been concentrated in the cities. The families that in the time of
19010	slavery would have been found only in the country are now found, with a
19011	few exceptions, in the towns. The transplantation has been practically
19012	universal. The talent, the energy, the ambition that formerly sought
19013	expression in the management of great estates and the control of hosts
19014	of slaves, now seek a field of action in trade, in manufacturing
19015	enterprises, or in the general enterprises of development. This was for
19016	the ruling class of the South the natural outcome of the great economic
19017	revolution that followed the war."
19018	
19019	As in all other parts of the world, the mechanical revolution was
19020	attended by the growth of a population of industrial workers dependent
19021	not upon the soil but upon wages for their livelihood. When Jefferson
19022	Davis was inaugurated President of the Southern Confederacy, there were
19023	approximately only one hundred thousand persons employed in Southern
19024	manufactures as against more than a million in Northern mills. Fifty
19025	years later, Georgia and Alabama alone had more than one hundred and
19026	fifty thousand wage-earners. Necessarily this meant also a material
19027	increase in urban population, although the wide dispersion of cotton
19028	spinning among small centers prevented the congestion that had
19029	accompanied the rise of the textile industry in New England. In 1910,
19030	New Orleans, Atlanta, Memphis, Nashville, and Houston stood in the same
19031	relation to the New South that Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland, and
19032	Detroit had stood to the New West fifty years before. The problems of
19033	labor and capital and municipal administration, which the earlier
19034	writers boasted would never perplex the planting South, had come in full
19035	force.

19040	
19041	=The Revolution in the Status of the Slaves.=--No part of Southern
19042	society was so profoundly affected by the Civil War and economic
19043	reconstruction as the former slaves. On the day of emancipation, they
19044	stood free, but empty-handed, the owners of no tools or property, the
19045	masters of no trade and wholly inexperienced in the arts of self-help
19046	that characterized the whites in general. They had never been accustomed
19047	to looking out for themselves. The plantation bell had called them to
19048	labor and released them. Doles of food and clothing had been regularly
19049	made in given quantities. They did not understand wages, ownership,
19050	renting, contracts, mortgages, leases, bills, or accounts.
19051	
19052	When they were emancipated, four courses were open to them. They could
19053	flee from the plantation to the nearest town or city, or to the distant
19054	North, to seek a livelihood. Thousands of them chose this way,
19055	overcrowding cities where disease mowed them down. They could remain
19056	where they, were in their cabins and work for daily wages instead of
19057	food, clothing, and shelter. This second course the major portion of
19058	them chose; but, as few masters had cash to dispense, the new relation
19059	was much like the old, in fact. It was still one of barter. The planter
19060	offered food, clothing, and shelter; the former slaves gave their labor
19061	in return. That was the best that many of them could do.
19062	
19063	A third course open to freedmen was that of renting from the former
19064	master, paying him usually with a share of the produce of the land. This
19065	way a large number of them chose. It offered them a chance to become
19066	land owners in time and it afforded an easier life, the renter being, to
19067	a certain extent at least, master of his own hours of labor. The final
19068	and most difficult path was that to ownership of land. Many a master
19069	helped his former slaves to acquire small holdings by offering easy
19070	terms. The more enterprising and the more fortunate who started life as
19071	renters or wage-earners made their way upward to ownership in so many
19072	cases that by the end of the century, one-fourth of the colored laborers
19073	on the land owned the soil they tilled.
19074	
19075	In the meantime, the South, though relatively poor, made relatively
19076	large expenditures for the education of the colored population. By the
19077	opening of the twentieth century, facilities were provided for more than
19078	one-half of the colored children of school age. While in many respects
19079	this progress was disappointing, its significance, to be appreciated,
19080	must be derived from a comparison with the total illiteracy which
19081	prevailed under slavery.
19082	
19083	In spite of all that happened, however, the status of the negroes in the
19084	South continued to give a peculiar character to that section of the
19085	country. They were almost entirely excluded from the exercise of the
19086	suffrage, especially in the Far South. Special rooms were set aside for
19087	them at the railway stations and special cars on the railway lines. In
19088	the field of industry calling for technical skill, it appears, from the
19089	census figures, that they lost ground between 1890 and 1900--a condition
19090	which their friends ascribed to discriminations against them in law and
19091	in labor organizations and their critics ascribed to their lack of
19092	aptitude. Whatever may be the truth, the fact remained that at the
19093	opening of the twentieth century neither the hopes of the emancipators
19094	nor the fears of their opponents were realized. The marks of the
19095	"peculiar institution" were still largely impressed upon Southern
19096	society.
19097	
19098	The situation, however, was by no means unchanging. On the contrary
19099	there was a decided drift in affairs. For one thing, the proportion of
19100	negroes in the South had slowly declined. By 1900 they were in a
19101	majority in only two states, South Carolina and Mississippi. In
19102	Arkansas, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina the proportion of
19103	the white population was steadily growing. The colored migration
19104	northward increased while the westward movement of white farmers which
19105	characterized pioneer days declined. At the same time a part of the
19106	foreign immigration into the United States was diverted southward. As
19107	the years passed these tendencies gained momentum. The already huge
19108	colored quarters in some Northern cities were widely expanded, as whole
19109	counties in the South were stripped of their colored laborers. The race
19110	question, in its political and economic aspects, became less and less
19111	sectional, more and more national. The South was drawn into the main
19112	stream of national life. The separatist forces which produced the
19113	cataclysm of 1861 sank irresistibly into the background.

19217	BUSINESS ENTERPRISE AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
19218	
19219	
19220	If a single phrase be chosen to characterize American life during the
19221	generation that followed the age of Douglas and Lincoln, it must be
19222	"business enterprise"--the tremendous, irresistible energy of a virile
19223	people, mounting in numbers toward a hundred million and applied without
19224	let or hindrance to the developing of natural resources of unparalleled
19225	richness. The chief goal of this effort was high profits for the
19226	captains of industry, on the one hand; and high wages for the workers,
19227	on the other. Its signs, to use the language of a Republican orator in
19228	1876, were golden harvest fields, whirling spindles, turning wheels,
19229	open furnace doors, flaming forges, and chimneys filled with eager fire.
19230	The device blazoned on its shield and written over its factory doors was
19231	"prosperity." A Republican President was its "advance agent." Released
19232	from the hampering interference of the Southern planters and the
19233	confusing issues of the slavery controversy, business enterprise sprang
19234	forward to the task of winning the entire country. Then it flung its
19235	outposts to the uttermost parts of the earth--Europe, Africa, and the
19236	Orient--where were to be found markets for American goods and natural
19237	resources for American capital to develop.
19238	
19239	
19240	RAILWAYS AND INDUSTRY
19241	
19242	=The Outward Signs of Enterprise.=--It is difficult to comprehend all
19243	the multitudinous activities of American business energy or to appraise
19244	its effects upon the life and destiny of the American people; for beyond
19245	the horizon of the twentieth century lie consequences as yet undreamed
19246	of in our poor philosophy. Statisticians attempt to record its
19247	achievements in terms of miles of railways built, factories opened, men
19248	and women employed, fortunes made, wages paid, cities founded, rivers
19249	spanned, boxes, bales, and tons produced. Historians apply standards of
19250	comparison with the past. Against the slow and leisurely stagecoach,
19251	they set the swift express, rushing from New York to San Francisco in
19252	less time than Washington consumed in his triumphal tour from Mt. Vernon
19253	to New York for his first inaugural. Against the lazy sailing vessel
19254	drifting before a genial breeze, they place the turbine steamer crossing
19255	the Atlantic in five days or the still swifter airplane, in fifteen
19256	hours. For the old workshop where a master and a dozen workmen and
19257	apprentices wrought by hand, they offer the giant factory where ten
19258	thousand persons attend the whirling wheels driven by steam. They write
19259	of the "romance of invention" and the "captains of industry."
19260

19263	A CORNER IN THE BETHLEHEM STEEL WORKS]
19264	
19265	=The Service of the Railway.=--All this is fitting in its way. Figures
19266	and contrasts cannot, however, tell the whole story. Take, for example,
19267	the extension of railways. It is easy to relate that there were 30,000
19268	miles in 1860; 166,000 in 1890; and 242,000 in 1910. It is easy to show
19269	upon the map how a few straggling lines became a perfect mesh of closely
19270	knitted railways; or how, like the tentacles of a great monster, the few
19271	roads ending in the Mississippi Valley in 1860 were extended and
19272	multiplied until they tapped every wheat field, mine, and forest beyond
19273	the valley. All this, eloquent of enterprise as it truly is, does not
19274	reveal the significance of railways for American life. It does not
19275	indicate how railways made a continental market for American goods; nor
19276	how they standardized the whole country, giving to cities on the
19277	advancing frontier the leading features of cities in the old East; nor
19278	how they carried to the pioneer the comforts of civilization; nor yet
19279	how in the West they were the forerunners of civilization, the makers of
19280	homesteads, the builders of states.
19281	
19282	=Government Aid for Railways.=--Still the story is not ended. The
19283	significant relation between railways and politics must not be
19284	overlooked. The bounty of a lavish government, for example, made
19285	possible the work of railway promoters. By the year 1872 the Federal
19286	government had granted in aid of railways 155,000,000 acres of land--an
19287	area estimated as almost equal to Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut,
19288	Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The
19289	Union Pacific Company alone secured from the federal government a free
19290	right of way through the public domain, twenty sections of land with
19291	each mile of railway, and a loan up to fifty millions of dollars secured
19292	by a second mortgage on the company's property. More than half of the
19293	northern tier of states lying against Canada from Lake Michigan to the
19294	Pacific was granted to private companies in aid of railways and wagon
19295	roads. About half of New Mexico, Arizona, and California was also given
19296	outright to railway companies. These vast grants from the federal
19297	government were supplemented by gifts from the states in land and by
19298	subscriptions amounting to more than two hundred million dollars. The
19299	history of these gifts and their relation to the political leaders that
19300	engineered them would alone fill a large and interesting volume.
19301	
19302	=Railway Fortunes and Capital.=--Out of this gigantic railway promotion,
19303	the first really immense American fortunes were made. Henry Adams, the
19304	grandson of John Quincy Adams, related that his grandfather on his
19305	mother's side, Peter Brooks, on his death in 1849, left a fortune of two
19306	million dollars, "supposed to be the largest estate in Boston," then one
19307	of the few centers of great riches. Compared with the opulence that
19308	sprang out of the Union Pacific, the Northern Pacific, the Southern
19309	Pacific, with their subsidiary and component lines, the estate of Peter
19310	Brooks was a poor man's heritage.
19311	
19312	The capital invested in these railways was enormous beyond the
19313	imagination of the men of the stagecoach generation. The total debt of
19314	the United States incurred in the Revolutionary War--a debt which those
19315	of little faith thought the country could never pay--was reckoned at a
19316	figure well under $75,000,000. When the Union Pacific Railroad was
19317	completed, there were outstanding against it $27,000,000 in first
19318	mortgage bonds, $27,000,000 in second mortgage bonds held by the
19319	government, $10,000,000 in income bonds, $10,000,000 in land grant
19320	bonds, and, on top of that huge bonded indebtedness, $36,000,000 in
19321	stock--making $110,000,000 in all. If the amount due the United States
19322	government be subtracted, still there remained, in private hands, stocks
19323	and bonds exceeding in value the whole national debt of Hamilton's
19324	day--a debt that strained all the resources of the Federal government in
19325	1790. Such was the financial significance of the railways.
19326	
19327	[Illustration: RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1918]
19328	
19329	=Growth and Extension of Industry.=--In the field of manufacturing,
19330	mining, and metal working, the results of business enterprise far
19331	outstripped, if measured in mere dollars, the results of railway
19332	construction. By the end of the century there were about ten billion
19333	dollars invested in factories alone and five million wage-earners
19334	employed in them; while the total value of the output, fourteen billion
19335	dollars, was fifteen times the figure for 1860. In the Eastern states
19336	industries multiplied. In the Northwest territory, the old home of
19337	Jacksonian Democracy, they overtopped agriculture. By the end of the
19338	century, Ohio had almost reached and Illinois had surpassed
19339	Massachusetts in the annual value of manufacturing output.
19340	
19341	That was not all. Untold wealth in the form of natural resources was
19342	discovered in the South and West. Coal deposits were found in the
19343	Appalachians stretching from Pennsylvania down to Alabama, in Michigan,
19344	in the Mississippi Valley, and in the Western mountains from North
19345	Dakota to New Mexico. In nearly every coal-bearing region, iron was also
19346	discovered and the great fields of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota
19347	soon rivaled those of the Appalachian area. Copper, lead, gold, and
19348	silver in fabulous quantities were unearthed by the restless prospectors
19349	who left no plain or mountain fastness unexplored. Petroleum, first
19350	pumped from the wells of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1859, made new
19351	fortunes equaling those of trade, railways, and land speculation. It
19352	scattered its riches with an especially lavish hand through Oklahoma,
19353	Texas, and California.
19354	
19355	=The Trust--an Instrument of Industrial Progress.=--Business enterprise,
19356	under the direction of powerful men working single-handed, or of small
19357	groups of men pooling their capital for one or more undertakings, had
19358	not advanced far before there appeared upon the scene still mightier
19359	leaders of even greater imagination. New constructive genius now brought
19360	together and combined under one management hundreds of concerns or
19361	thousands of miles of railways, revealing the magic strength of
19362	cooperation on a national scale. Price-cutting in oil, threatening ruin
19363	to those engaged in the industry, as early as 1879, led a number of
19364	companies in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia to unite in
19365	price-fixing. Three years later a group of oil interests formed a close
19366	organization, placing all their stocks in the hands of trustees, among
19367	whom was John D. Rockefeller. The trustees, in turn, issued
19368	certificates representing the share to which each participant was
19369	entitled; and took over the management of the entire business. Such was
19370	the nature of the "trust," which was to play such an unique role in the
19371	progress of America.
19372	
19373	The idea of combination was applied in time to iron and steel, copper,
19374	lead, sugar, cordage, coal, and other commodities, until in each field
19375	there loomed a giant trust or corporation, controlling, if not most of
19376	the output, at least enough to determine in a large measure the prices
19377	charged to consumers. With the passing years, the railways, mills,
19378	mines, and other business concerns were transferred from individual
19379	owners to corporations. At the end of the nineteenth century, the whole
19380	face of American business was changed. Three-fourths of the output from
19381	industries came from factories under corporate management and only
19382	one-fourth from individual and partnership undertakings.

19385	
19386	=The Banking Corporation.=--Very closely related to the growth of
19387	business enterprise on a large scale was the system of banking. In the
19388	old days before banks, a person with savings either employed them in his
19389	own undertakings, lent them to a neighbor, or hid them away where they
19390	set no industry in motion. Even in the early stages of modern business,
19391	it was common for a manufacturer to rise from small beginnings by
19392	financing extensions out of his own earnings and profits. This state of
19393	affairs was profoundly altered by the growth of the huge corporations
19394	requiring millions and even billions of capital. The banks, once an
19395	adjunct to business, became the leaders in business.
19396	
19397	[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._

19400	
19401	It was the banks that undertook to sell the stocks and bonds issued by
19402	new corporations and trusts and to supply them with credit to carry on
19403	their operations. Indeed, many of the great mergers or combinations in
19404	business were initiated by magnates in the banking world with millions
19405	and billions under their control. Through their connections with one
19406	another, the banks formed a perfect network of agencies gathering up the
19407	pennies and dollars of the masses as well as the thousands of the rich
19408	and pouring them all into the channels of business and manufacturing.
19409	In this growth of banking on a national scale, it was inevitable that a
19410	few great centers, like Wall Street in New York or State Street in
19411	Boston, should rise to a position of dominance both in concentrating the
19412	savings and profits of the nation and in financing new as well as old
19413	corporations.
19414	
19415	=The Significance of the Corporation.=--The corporation, in fact, became
19416	the striking feature of American business life, one of the most
19417	marvelous institutions of all time, comparable in wealth and power and
19418	the number of its servants with kingdoms and states of old. The effect
19419	of its rise and growth cannot be summarily estimated; but some special
19420	facts are obvious. It made possible gigantic enterprises once entirely
19421	beyond the reach of any individual, no matter how rich. It eliminated
19422	many of the futile and costly wastes of competition in connection with
19423	manufacture, advertising, and selling. It studied the cheapest methods
19424	of production and shut down mills that were poorly equipped or
19425	disadvantageously located. It established laboratories for research in
19426	industry, chemistry, and mechanical inventions. Through the sale of
19427	stocks and bonds, it enabled tens of thousands of people to become
19428	capitalists, if only in a small way. The corporation made it possible
19429	for one person to own, for instance, a $50 share in a million dollar
19430	business concern--a thing entirely impossible under a regime of
19431	individual owners and partnerships.
19432	
19433	There was, of course, another side to the picture. Many of the
19434	corporations sought to become monopolies and to make profits, not by
19435	economies and good management, but by extortion from purchasers.
19436	Sometimes they mercilessly crushed small business men, their
19437	competitors, bribed members of legislatures to secure favorable laws,
19438	and contributed to the campaign funds of both leading parties. Wherever
19439	a trust approached the position of a monopoly, it acquired a dominion
19440	over the labor market which enabled it to break even the strongest trade
19441	unions. In short, the power of the trust in finance, in manufacturing,
19442	in politics, and in the field of labor control can hardly be measured.
19443	
19444	=The Corporation and Labor.=--In the development of the corporation
19445	there was to be observed a distinct severing of the old ties between
19446	master and workmen, which existed in the days of small industries. For
19447	the personal bond between the owner and the employees was substituted a
19448	new relation. "In most parts of our country," as President Wilson once
19449	said, "men work, not for themselves, not as partners in the old way in
19450	which they used to work, but generally as employees--in a higher or
19451	lower grade--of great corporations." The owner disappeared from the
19452	factory and in his place came the manager, representing the usually
19453	invisible stockholders and dependent for his success upon his ability to
19454	make profits for the owners. Hence the term "soulless corporation,"
19455	which was to exert such a deep influence on American thinking about
19456	industrial relations.
19457	
19458	=Cities and Immigration.=--Expressed in terms of human life, this era of
19459	unprecedented enterprise meant huge industrial cities and an immense
19460	labor supply, derived mainly from European immigration. Here, too,
19461	figures tell only a part of the story. In Washington's day nine-tenths
19462	of the American people were engaged in agriculture and lived in the
19463	country; in 1890 more than one-third of the population dwelt in towns of
19464	2500 and over; in 1920 more than half of the population lived in towns
19465	of over 2500. In forty years, between 1860 and 1900, Greater New York
19466	had grown from 1,174,000 to 3,437,000; San Francisco from 56,000 to
19467	342,000; Chicago from 109,000 to 1,698,000. The miles of city tenements
19468	began to rival, in the number of their residents, the farm homesteads of
19469	the West. The time so dreaded by Jefferson had arrived. People were
19470	"piled upon one another in great cities" and the republic of small
19471	farmers had passed away.
19472	
19473	To these industrial centers flowed annually an ever-increasing tide of
19474	immigration, reaching the half million point in 1880; rising to
19475	three-quarters of a million three years later; and passing the million
19476	mark in a single year at the opening of the new century. Immigration was
19477	as old as America but new elements now entered the situation. In the
19478	first place, there were radical changes in the nationality of the
19479	newcomers. The migration from Northern Europe--England, Ireland,
19480	Germany, and Scandinavia--diminished; that from Italy, Russia, and
19481	Austria-Hungary increased, more than three-fourths of the entire number
19482	coming from these three lands between the years 1900 and 1910. These
19483	later immigrants were Italians, Poles, Magyars, Czechs, Slovaks,
19484	Russians, and Jews, who came from countries far removed from the
19485	language and the traditions of England whence came the founders of
19486	America.
19487	
19488	In the second place, the reception accorded the newcomers differed from
19489	that given to the immigrants in the early days. By 1890 all the free
19490	land was gone. They could not, therefore, be dispersed widely among the
19491	native Americans to assimilate quickly and unconsciously the habits and
19492	ideas of American life. On the contrary, they were diverted mainly to
19493	the industrial centers. There they crowded--nay, overcrowded--into
19494	colonies of their own where they preserved their languages, their
19495	newspapers, and their old-world customs and views.
19496	
19497	So eager were American business men to get an enormous labor supply that
19498	they asked few questions about the effect of this "alien invasion" upon
19499	the old America inherited from the fathers. They even stimulated the
19500	invasion artificially by importing huge armies of foreigners under
19501	contract to work in specified mines and mills. There seemed to be no
19502	limit to the factories, forges, refineries, and railways that could be
19503	built, to the multitudes that could be employed in conquering a
19504	continent. As for the future, that was in the hands of Providence!
19505	
19506	=Business Theories of Politics.=--As the statesmen of Hamilton's school
19507	and the planters of Calhoun's had their theories of government and
19508	politics, so the leaders in business enterprise had theirs. It was
19509	simple and easily stated. "It is the duty of the government," they
19510	urged, "to protect American industry against foreign competition by
19511	means of high tariffs on imported goods, to aid railways by generous
19512	grants of land, to sell mineral and timber lands at low prices to
19513	energetic men ready to develop them, and then to leave the rest to the
19514	initiative and drive of individuals and companies." All government
19515	interference with the management, prices, rates, charges, and conduct of
19516	private business they held to be either wholly pernicious or intolerably
19517	impertinent. Judging from their speeches and writings, they conceived
19518	the nation as a great collection of individuals, companies, and labor
19519	unions all struggling for profits or high wages and held together by a
19520	government whose principal duty was to keep the peace among them and
19521	protect industry against the foreign manufacturer. Such was the
19522	political theory of business during the generation that followed the
19523	Civil War.
19524	
19525	
19526	THE SUPREMACY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY (1861-85)
19527	
19528	=Business Men and Republican Policies.=--Most of the leaders in industry
19529	gravitated to the Republican ranks. They worked in the North and the
19530	Republican party was essentially Northern. It was moreover--at least so
19531	far as the majority of its members were concerned--committed to
19532	protective tariffs, a sound monetary and banking system, the promotion
19533	of railways and industry by land grants, and the development of internal
19534	improvements. It was furthermore generous in its immigration policy. It
19535	proclaimed America to be an asylum for the oppressed of all countries
19536	and flung wide the doors for immigrants eager to fill the factories, man
19537	the mines, and settle upon Western lands. In a word the Republicans
19538	stood for all those specific measures which favored the enlargement and
19539	prosperity of business. At the same time they resisted government
19540	interference with private enterprise. They did not regulate railway
19541	rates, prosecute trusts for forming combinations, or prevent railway
19542	companies from giving lower rates to some shippers than to others. To
19543	sum it up, the political theories of the Republican party for three
19544	decades after the Civil War were the theories of American
19545	business--prosperous and profitable industries for the owners and "the
19546	full dinner pail" for the workmen. Naturally a large portion of those
19547	who flourished under its policies gave their support to it, voted for
19548	its candidates, and subscribed to its campaign funds.
19549	
19550	=Sources of Republican Strength in the North.=--The Republican party was
19551	in fact a political organization of singular power. It originated in a
19552	wave of moral enthusiasm, having attracted to itself, if not the
19553	abolitionists, certainly all those idealists, like James Russell Lowell
19554	and George William Curtis, who had opposed slavery when opposition was
19555	neither safe nor popular. To moral principles it added practical
19556	considerations. Business men had confidence in it. Workingmen, who
19557	longed for the independence of the farmer, owed to its indulgent land
19558	policy the opportunity of securing free homesteads in the West. The
19559	immigrant, landing penniless on these shores, as a result of the same
19560	beneficent system, often found himself in a little while with an estate
19561	as large as many a baronial domain in the Old World. Under a Republican
19562	administration, the union had been saved. To it the veterans of the war
19563	could turn with confidence for those rewards of service which the
19564	government could bestow: pensions surpassing in liberality anything that
19565	the world had ever seen. Under a Republican administration also the
19566	great debt had been created in the defense of the union, and to the
19567	Republican party every investor in government bonds could look for the
19568	full and honorable discharge of the interest and principal. The spoils
19569	system, inaugurated by Jacksonian Democracy, in turn placed all the
19570	federal offices in Republican hands, furnishing an army of party workers
19571	to be counted on for loyal service in every campaign.
19572	
19573	Of all these things Republican leaders made full and vigorous use,
19574	sometimes ascribing to the party, in accordance with ancient political
19575	usage, merits and achievements not wholly its own. Particularly was this
19576	true in the case of saving the union. "When in the economy of
19577	Providence, this land was to be purged of human slavery ... the
19578	Republican party came into power," ran a declaration in one platform.
19579	"The Republican party suppressed a gigantic rebellion, emancipated four
19580	million slaves, decreed the equal citizenship of all, and established
19581	universal suffrage," ran another. As for the aid rendered by the
19582	millions of Northern Democrats who stood by the union and the tens of
19583	thousands of them who actually fought in the union army, the Republicans
19584	in their zeal were inclined to be oblivious. They repeatedly charged the
19585	Democratic party "with being the same in character and spirit as when it
19586	sympathized with treason."
19587	
19588	=Republican Control of the South.=--To the strength enjoyed in the
19589	North, the Republicans for a long time added the advantages that came
19590	from control over the former Confederate states where the newly
19591	enfranchised negroes, under white leadership, gave a grateful support to
19592	the party responsible for their freedom. In this branch of politics,
19593	motives were so mixed that no historian can hope to appraise them all at
19594	their proper values. On the one side of the ledger must be set the
19595	vigorous efforts of the honest and sincere friends of the freedmen to
19596	win for them complete civil and political equality, wiping out not only
19597	slavery but all its badges of misery and servitude. On the same side
19598	must be placed the labor of those who had valiantly fought in forum and
19599	field to save the union and who regarded continued Republican supremacy
19600	after the war as absolutely necessary to prevent the former leaders in
19601	secession from coming back to power. At the same time there were
19602	undoubtedly some men of the baser sort who looked on politics as a game
19603	and who made use of "carpet-bagging" in the South to win the spoils that
19604	might result from it. At all events, both by laws and presidential acts,
19605	the Republicans for many years kept a keen eye upon the maintenance of
19606	their dominion in the South. Their declaration that neither the law nor
19607	its administration should admit any discrimination in respect of
19608	citizens by reason of race, color, or previous condition of servitude
19609	appealed to idealists and brought results in elections. Even South
19610	Carolina, where reposed the ashes of John C. Calhoun, went Republican in
19611	1872 by a vote of three to one!
19612	
19613	Republican control was made easy by the force bills described in a
19614	previous chapter--measures which vested the supervision of elections in
19615	federal officers appointed by Republican Presidents. These drastic
19616	measures, departing from American tradition, the Republican authors
19617	urged, were necessary to safeguard the purity of the ballot, not merely
19618	in the South where the timid freedman might readily be frightened from
19619	using it; but also in the North, particularly in New York City, where it
19620	was claimed that fraud was regularly practiced by Democratic leaders.
19621	
19622	The Democrats, on their side, indignantly denied the charges, replying
19623	that the force bills were nothing but devices created by the Republicans
19624	for the purpose of securing their continued rule through systematic
19625	interference with elections. Even the measures of reconstruction were
19626	deemed by Democratic leaders as thinly veiled schemes to establish
19627	Republican power throughout the country. "Nor is there the slightest
19628	doubt," exclaimed Samuel J. Tilden, spokesman of the Democrats in New
19629	York and candidate for President in 1876, "that the paramount object and
19630	motive of the Republican party is by these means to secure itself
19631	against a reaction of opinion adverse to it in our great populous
19632	Northern commonwealths.... When the Republican party resolved to
19633	establish negro supremacy in the ten states in order to gain to itself
19634	the representation of those states in Congress, it had to begin by
19635	governing the people of those states by the sword.... The next was the
19636	creation of new electoral bodies for those ten states, in which, by
19637	exclusions, by disfranchisements and proscriptions, by control over
19638	registration, by applying test oaths ... by intimidation and by every
19639	form of influence, three million negroes are made to predominate over
19640	four and a half million whites."
19641	
19642	=The War as a Campaign Issue.=--Even the repeal of force bills could not
19643	allay the sectional feelings engendered by the war. The Republicans
19644	could not forgive the men who had so recently been in arms against the
19645	union and insisted on calling them "traitors" and "rebels." The
19646	Southerners, smarting under the reconstruction acts, could regard the
19647	Republicans only as political oppressors. The passions of the war had
19648	been too strong; the distress too deep to be soon forgotten. The
19649	generation that went through it all remembered it all. For twenty
19650	years, the Republicans, in their speeches and platforms, made "a
19651	straight appeal to the patriotism of the Northern voters." They
19652	maintained that their party, which had saved the union and emancipated
19653	the slaves, was alone worthy of protecting the union and uplifting the
19654	freedmen.
19655	
19656	Though the Democrats, especially in the North, resented this policy and
19657	dubbed it with the expressive but inelegant phrase, "waving the bloody
19658	shirt," the Republicans refused to surrender a slogan which made such a
19659	ready popular appeal. As late as 1884, a leader expressed the hope that
19660	they might "wring one more President from the bloody shirt." They
19661	refused to let the country forget that the Democratic candidate, Grover
19662	Cleveland, had escaped military service by hiring a substitute; and they
19663	made political capital out of the fact that he had "insulted the
19664	veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic" by going fishing on
19665	Decoration Day.
19666	
19667	=Three Republican Presidents.=--Fortified by all these elements of
19668	strength, the Republicans held the presidency from 1869 to 1885. The
19669	three Presidents elected in this period, Grant, Hayes, and Garfield, had
19670	certain striking characteristics in common. They were all of origin
19671	humble enough to please the most exacting Jacksonian Democrat. They had
19672	been generals in the union army. Grant, next to Lincoln, was regarded as
19673	the savior of the Constitution. Hayes and Garfield, though lesser lights
19674	in the military firmament, had honorable records duly appreciated by
19675	veterans of the war, now thoroughly organized into the Grand Army of the
19676	Republic. It is true that Grant was not a politician and had never voted
19677	the Republican ticket; but this was readily overlooked. Hayes and
19678	Garfield on the other hand were loyal party men. The former had served
19679	in Congress and for three terms as governor of his state. The latter had
19680	long been a member of the House of Representatives and was Senator-elect
19681	when he received the nomination for President.
19682	
19683	All of them possessed, moreover, another important asset, which was not
19684	forgotten by the astute managers who led in selecting candidates. All
19685	of them were from Ohio--though Grant had been in Illinois when the
19686	summons to military duties came--and Ohio was a strategic state. It lay
19687	between the manufacturing East and the agrarian country to the West.
19688	Having growing industries and wool to sell it benefited from the
19689	protective tariff. Yet being mainly agricultural still, it was not
19690	
19691	without sympathy for the farmers who showed low tariff or free trade
19692	tendencies. Whatever share the East had in shaping laws and framing
19693	policies, it was clear that the West was to have the candidates. This
19694	division in privileges--not uncommon in political management--was always
19695	accompanied by a judicious selection of the candidate for Vice
19696	President. With Garfield, for example, was associated a prominent New
19697	York politician, Chester A. Arthur, who, as fate decreed, was destined
19698	to more than three years' service as chief magistrate, on the
19699	assassination of his superior in office.
19700	
19701	=The Disputed Election of 1876.=--While taking note of the long years of
19702	Republican supremacy, it must be recorded that grave doubts exist in the
19703	minds of many historians as to whether one of the three Presidents,
19704	Hayes, was actually the victor in 1876 or not. His Democratic opponent,
19705	Samuel J. Tilden, received a popular plurality of a quarter of a million
19706	and had a plausible claim to a majority of the electoral vote. At all
19707	events, four states sent in double returns, one set for Tilden and
19708	another for Hayes; and a deadlock ensued. Both parties vehemently
19709	claimed the election and the passions ran so high that sober men did not
19710	shrink from speaking of civil war again. Fortunately, in the end, the
19711	counsels of peace prevailed. Congress provided for an electoral
19712	commission of fifteen men to review the contested returns. The
19713	Democrats, inspired by Tilden's moderation, accepted the judgment in
19714	favor of Hayes even though they were not convinced that he was really
19715	entitled to the office.
19716	
19717	
19718	THE GROWTH OF OPPOSITION TO REPUBLICAN RULE
19719	
19720	=Abuses in American Political Life.=--During their long tenure of
19721	office, the Republicans could not escape the inevitable consequences of
19722	power; that is, evil practices and corrupt conduct on the part of some
19723	who found shelter within the party. For that matter neither did the
19724	Democrats manage to avoid such difficulties in those states and cities
19725	where they had the majority. In New York City, for instance, the local
19726	Democratic organization, known as Tammany Hall, passed under the sway of
19727	a group of politicians headed by "Boss" Tweed. He plundered the city
19728	treasury until public-spirited citizens, supported by Samuel J. Tilden,
19729	the Democratic leader of the state, rose in revolt, drove the ringleader
19730	from power, and sent him to jail. In Philadelphia, the local Republican
19731	bosses were guilty of offenses as odious as those committed by New York
19732	politicians. Indeed, the decade that followed the Civil War was marred
19733	by so many scandals in public life that one acute editor was moved to
19734	inquire: "Are not all the great communities of the Western World growing
19735	more corrupt as they grow in wealth?"
19736	
19737	In the sphere of national politics, where the opportunities were
19738	greater, betrayals of public trust were even more flagrant. One
19739	revelation after another showed officers, high and low, possessed with
19740	the spirit of peculation. Members of Congress, it was found, accepted
19741	railway stock in exchange for votes in favor of land grants and other
19742	concessions to the companies. In the administration as well as the
19743	legislature the disease was rife. Revenue officers permitted whisky
19744	distillers to evade their taxes and received heavy bribes in return. A
19745	probe into the post-office department revealed the malodorous "star
19746	route frauds"--the deliberate overpayment of certain mail carriers whose
19747	lines were indicated in the official record by asterisks or stars. Even
19748	cabinet officers did not escape suspicion, for the trail of the serpent
19749	led straight to the door of one of them.
19750	
19751	In the lower ranges of official life, the spoils system became more
19752	virulent as the number of federal employees increased. The holders of
19753	offices and the seekers after them constituted a veritable political
19754	army. They crowded into Republican councils, for the Republicans, being
19755	in power, could alone dispense federal favors. They filled positions in
19756	the party ranging from the lowest township committee to the national
19757	convention. They helped to nominate candidates and draft platforms and
19758	elbowed to one side the busy citizen, not conversant with party
19759	intrigues, who could only give an occasional day to political matters.
19760	Even the Civil Service Act of 1883, wrung from a reluctant Congress two
19761	years after the assassination of Garfield, made little change for a long
19762	time. It took away from the spoilsmen a few thousand government
19763	positions, but it formed no check on the practice of rewarding party
19764	workers from the public treasury.
19765	
19766	On viewing this state of affairs, many a distinguished citizen became
19767	profoundly discouraged. James Russell Lowell, for example, thought he
19768	saw a steady decline in public morals. In 1865, hearing of Lee's
19769	surrender, he had exclaimed: "There is something magnificent in having a
19770	country to love!" Ten years later, when asked to write an ode for the
19771	centennial at Philadelphia in 1876, he could think only of a biting
19772	satire on the nation:
19773	
19774	    "Show your state legislatures; show your Rings;
19775	     And challenge Europe to produce such things
19776	     As high officials sitting half in sight
19777	     To share the plunder and fix things right.
19778	     If that don't fetch her, why, you need only
19779	     To show your latest style in martyrs,--Tweed:
19780	     She'll find it hard to hide her spiteful tears
19781	     At such advance in one poor hundred years."
19782	
19783	When his critics condemned him for this "attack upon his native land,"
19784	Lowell replied in sadness: "These fellows have no notion of what love of
19785	country means. It was in my very blood and bones. If I am not an
19786	American who ever was?... What fills me with doubt and dismay is the
19787	degradation of the moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of democracy?
19788	Is ours a 'government of the people, by the people, for the people,' or
19789	a Kakistocracy [a government of the worst], rather for the benefit of
19790	knaves at the cost of fools?"
19791	
19792	=The Reform Movement in Republican Ranks.=--The sentiments expressed by
19793	Lowell, himself a Republican and for a time American ambassador to
19794	England, were shared by many men in his party. Very soon after the close
19795	of the Civil War some of them began to protest vigorously against the
19796	policies and conduct of their leaders. In 1872, the dissenters, calling
19797	themselves Liberal Republicans, broke away altogether, nominated a
19798	candidate of their own, Horace Greeley, and put forward a platform
19799	indicting the Republican President fiercely enough to please the most
19800	uncompromising Democrat. They accused Grant of using "the powers and
19801	opportunities of his high office for the promotion of personal ends."
19802	They charged him with retaining "notoriously corrupt and unworthy men in
19803	places of power and responsibility." They alleged that the Republican
19804	party kept "alive the passions and resentments of the late civil war to
19805	use them for their own advantages," and employed the "public service of
19806	the government as a machinery of corruption and personal influence."
19807	
19808	It was not apparent, however, from the ensuing election that any
19809	considerable number of Republicans accepted the views of the Liberals.
19810	Greeley, though indorsed by the Democrats, was utterly routed and died
19811	of a broken heart. The lesson of his discomfiture seemed to be that
19812	independent action was futile. So, at least, it was regarded by most men
19813	of the rising generation like Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, and
19814	Theodore Roosevelt, of New York. Profiting by the experience of Greeley
19815	they insisted in season and out that reformers who desired to rid the
19816	party of abuses should remain loyal to it and do their work "on the
19817	inside."
19818	
19819	=The Mugwumps and Cleveland Democracy in 1884.=--Though aided by
19820	Republican dissensions, the Democrats were slow in making headway
19821	against the political current. They were deprived of the energetic and
19822	capable leadership once afforded by the planters, like Calhoun, Davis,
19823	and Toombs; they were saddled by their opponents with responsibility for
19824	secession; and they were stripped of the support of the prostrate
19825	South. Not until the last Southern state was restored to the union, not
19826	until a general amnesty was wrung from Congress, not until white
19827	supremacy was established at the polls, and the last federal soldier
19828	withdrawn from Southern capitals did they succeed in capturing the
19829	presidency.
19830	
19831	The opportune moment for them came in 1884 when a number of
19832	circumstances favored their aspirations. The Republicans, leaving the
19833	Ohio Valley in their search for a candidate, nominated James G. Blaine
19834	of Maine, a vigorous and popular leader but a man under fire from the
19835	reformers in his own party. The Democrats on their side were able to
19836	find at this juncture an able candidate who had no political enemies in
19837	the sphere of national politics, Grover Cleveland, then governor of New
19838	York and widely celebrated as a man of "sterling honesty." At the same
19839	time a number of dissatisfied Republicans openly espoused the Democratic
19840	cause,--among them Carl Schurz, George William Curtis, Henry Ward
19841	Beecher, and William Everett, men of fine ideals and undoubted
19842	integrity. Though the "regular" Republicans called them "Mugwumps" and
19843	laughed at them as the "men milliners, the dilettanti, and carpet
19844	knights of politics," they had a following that was not to be despised.
19845	
19846	The campaign which took place that year was one of the most savage in
19847	American history. Issues were thrust into the background. The tariff,
19848	though mentioned, was not taken seriously. Abuse of the opposition was
19849	the favorite resource of party orators. The Democrats insisted that "the
19850	Republican party so far as principle is concerned is a reminiscence. In
19851	practice it is an organization for enriching those who control its
19852	machinery." For the Republican candidate, Blaine, they could hardly find
19853	words to express their contempt. The Republicans retaliated in kind.
19854	They praised their own good works, as of old, in saving the union, and
19855	denounced the "fraud and violence practiced by the Democracy in the
19856	Southern states." Seeing little objectionable in the public record of
19857	Cleveland as mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York, they attacked
19858	his personal character. Perhaps never in the history of political
19859	campaigns did the discussions on the platform and in the press sink to
19860	so low a level. Decent people were sickened. Even hot partisans shrank
19861	from their own words when, after the election, they had time to reflect
19862	on their heedless passions. Moreover, nothing was decided by the
19863	balloting. Cleveland was elected, but his victory was a narrow one. A
19864	change of a few hundred votes in New York would have sent his opponent
19865	to the White House instead.
19866	
19867	=Changing Political Fortunes (1888-96).=--After the Democrats had
19868	settled down to the enjoyment of their hard-earned victory, President
19869	Cleveland in his message of 1887 attacked the tariff as "vicious,
19870	inequitable, and illogical"; as a system of taxation that laid a burden
19871	upon "every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers."
19872	Business enterprise was thoroughly alarmed. The Republicans
19873	characterized the tariff message as a free-trade assault upon the
19874	industries of the country. Mainly on that issue they elected in 1888
19875	Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, a shrewd lawyer, a reticent politician, a
19876	descendant of the hero of Tippecanoe, and a son of the old Northwest.
19877	Accepting the outcome of the election as a vindication of their
19878	principles, the Republicans, under the leadership of William McKinley in
19879	the House of Representatives, enacted in 1890 a tariff law imposing the
19880	highest duties yet laid in our history. To their utter surprise,
19881	however, they were instantly informed by the country that their program
19882	was not approved. That very autumn they lost in the congressional
19883	elections, and two years later they were decisively beaten in the
19884	presidential campaign, Cleveland once more leading his party to victory.

20000	
20001	THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT WEST
20002	
20003	
20004	At the close of the Civil War, Kansas and Texas were sentinel states on
20005	the middle border. Beyond the Rockies, California, Oregon, and Nevada
20006	stood guard, the last of them having been just admitted to furnish
20007	another vote for the fifteenth amendment abolishing slavery. Between the
20008	near and far frontiers lay a vast reach of plain, desert, plateau, and
20009	mountain, almost wholly undeveloped. A broad domain, extending from
20010	Canada to Mexico, and embracing the regions now included in Washington,
20011	Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, the Dakotas, and
20012	Oklahoma, had fewer than half a million inhabitants. It was laid out
20013	into territories, each administered under a governor appointed by the
20014	President and Senate and, as soon as there was the requisite number of
20015	inhabitants, a legislature elected by the voters. No railway line
20016	stretched across the desert. St. Joseph on the Missouri was the terminus
20017	of the Eastern lines. It required twenty-five days for a passenger to
20018	make the overland journey to California by the stagecoach system,
20019	established in 1858, and more than ten days for the swift pony express,
20020	organized in 1860, to carry a letter to San Francisco. Indians still
20021	roamed the plain and desert and more than one powerful tribe disputed
20022	the white man's title to the soil.
20023	
20024	
20025	THE RAILWAYS AS TRAIL BLAZERS
20026	
20027	=Opening Railways to the Pacific.=--A decade before the Civil War the
20028	importance of rail connection between the East and the Pacific Coast had
20029	been recognized. Pressure had already been brought to bear on Congress
20030	to authorize the construction of a line and to grant land and money in
20031	its aid. Both the Democrats and Republicans approved the idea, but it
20032	was involved in the slavery controversy. Indeed it was submerged in it.
20033	Southern statesmen wanted connections between the Gulf and the Pacific
20034	through Texas, while Northerners stood out for a central route.
20035	
20036	The North had its way during the war. Congress, by legislation initiated
20037	in 1862, provided for the immediate organization of companies to build a
20038	line from the Missouri River to California and made grants of land and
20039	loans of money to aid in the enterprise. The Western end, the Central
20040	Pacific, was laid out under the supervision of Leland Stanford. It was
20041	heavily financed by the Mormons of Utah and also by the state
20042	government, the ranchmen, miners, and business men of California; and it
20043	was built principally by Chinese labor. The Eastern end, the Union
20044	Pacific, starting at Omaha, was constructed mainly by veterans of the
20045	Civil War and immigrants from Ireland and Germany. In 1869 the two
20046	companies met near Ogden in Utah and the driving of the last spike,
20047	uniting the Atlantic and the Pacific, was the occasion of a great
20048	demonstration.
20049	
20050	Other lines to the Pacific were projected at the same time; but the
20051	panic of 1873 checked railway enterprise for a while. With the revival
20052	of prosperity at the end of that decade, construction was renewed with
20053	vigor and the year 1883 marked a series of railway triumphs. In February
20054	trains were running from New Orleans through Houston, San Antonio, and
20055	Yuma to San Francisco, as a result of a union of the Texas Pacific with
20056	the Southern Pacific and its subsidiary corporations. In September the
20057	last spike was driven in the Northern Pacific at Helena, Montana. Lake
20058	Superior was connected with Puget Sound. The waters explored by Joliet
20059	and Marquette were joined to the waters plowed by Sir Francis Drake
20060	while he was searching for a route around the world. That same year also
20061	a third line was opened to the Pacific by way of the Atchison, Topeka
20062	and Santa Fe, making connections through Albuquerque and Needles with
20063	San Francisco. The fondest hopes of railway promoters seemed to be
20064	realized.
20065	
20066	[Illustration: UNITED STATES IN 1870]
20067	
20068	=Western Railways Precede Settlement.=--In the Old World and on our
20069	Atlantic seaboard, railways followed population and markets. In the Far
20070	West, railways usually preceded the people. Railway builders planned
20071	cities on paper before they laid tracks connecting them. They sent
20072	missionaries to spread the gospel of "Western opportunity" to people in
20073	the Middle West, in the Eastern cities, and in Southern states. Then
20074	they carried their enthusiastic converts bag and baggage in long trains
20075	to the distant Dakotas and still farther afield. So the development of
20076	the Far West was not left to the tedious processes of time. It was
20077	pushed by men of imagination--adventurers who made a romance of
20078	money-making and who had dreams of empire unequaled by many kings of the
20079	past.
20080	
20081	These empire builders bought railway lands in huge tracts; they got more
20082	from the government; they overcame every obstacle of canon, mountain,
20083	and stream with the aid of science; they built cities according to the
20084	plans made by the engineers. Having the towns ready and railway and
20085	steamboat connections formed with the rest of the world, they carried
20086	out the people to use the railways, the steamships, the houses, and the
20087	land. It was in this way that "the frontier speculator paved the way for
20088	the frontier agriculturalist who had to be near a market before he could
20089	farm." The spirit of this imaginative enterprise, which laid out
20090	railways and towns in advance of the people, is seen in an advertisement
20091	of that day: "This extension will run 42 miles from York, northeast
20092	through the Island Lake country, and will have five good North Dakota
20093	towns. The stations on the line will be well equipped with elevators and
20094	will be constructed and ready for operation at the commencement of the
20095	grain season. Prospective merchants have been active in securing
20096	desirable locations at the different towns on the line. There are still
20097	opportunities for hotels, general merchandise, hardware, furniture, and
20098	drug stores, etc."

20102	A TOWN ON THE PRAIRIE]
20103	
20104	Among the railway promoters and builders in the West, James J. Hill,
20105	of the Great Northern and allied lines, was one of the most forceful
20106	figures. He knew that tracks and trains were useless without passengers
20107	and freight; without a population of farmers and town dwellers. He
20108	therefore organized publicity in the Virginias, Iowa, Ohio, Indiana,
20109	Illinois, Wisconsin, and Nebraska especially. He sent out agents to tell
20110	the story of Western opportunity in this vein: "You see your children
20111	come out of school with no chance to get farms of their own because the
20112	cost of land in your older part of the country is so high that you can't
20113	afford to buy land to start your sons out in life around you. They have
20114	to go to the cities to make a living or become laborers in the mills or
20115	hire out as farm hands. There is no future for them there. If you are
20116	doing well where you are and can safeguard the future of your children
20117	and see them prosper around you, don't leave here. But if you want
20118	independence, if you are renting your land, if the money-lender is
20119	carrying you along and you are running behind year after year, you can
20120	do no worse by moving.... You farmers talk of free trade and protection
20121	and what this or that political party will do for you. Why don't you
20122	vote a homestead for yourself? That is the only thing Uncle Sam will
20123	ever give you. Jim Hill hasn't an acre of land to sell you. We are not
20124	in the real estate business. We don't want you to go out West and make a
20125	failure of it because the rates at which we haul you and your goods make
20126	the first transaction a loss.... We must have landless men for a manless
20127	land."
20128	
20129	Unlike steamship companies stimulating immigration to get the fares,
20130	Hill was seeking permanent settlers who would produce, manufacture, and
20131	use the railways as the means of exchange. Consequently he fixed low
20132	rates and let his passengers take a good deal of live stock and
20133	household furniture free. By doing this he made an appeal that was
20134	answered by eager families. In 1894 the vanguard of home seekers left
20135	Indiana in fourteen passenger coaches, filled with men, women, and
20136	children, and forty-eight freight cars carrying their household goods
20137	and live stock. In the ten years that followed, 100,000 people from the
20138	Middle West and the South, responding to his call, went to the Western
20139	country where they brought eight million acres of prairie land under
20140	cultivation.
20141	
20142	When Hill got his people on the land, he took an interest in everything
20143	that increased the productivity of their labor. Was the output of food
20144	for his freight cars limited by bad drainage on the farms? Hill then
20145	interested himself in practical ways of ditching and tiling. Were
20146	farmers hampered in hauling their goods to his trains by bad roads? In
20147	that case, he urged upon the states the improvement of highways. Did the
20148	traffic slacken because the food shipped was not of the best quality?
20149	Then live stock must be improved and scientific farming promoted. Did
20150	the farmers need credit? Banks must be established close at hand to
20151	advance it. In all conferences on scientific farm management,
20152	conservation of natural resources, banking and credit in relation to
20153	agriculture and industry, Hill was an active participant. His was the
20154	long vision, seeing in conservation and permanent improvements the
20155	foundation of prosperity for the railways and the people.
20156	
20157	Indeed, he neglected no opportunity to increase the traffic on the
20158	lines. He wanted no empty cars running in either direction and no wheat
20159	stored in warehouses for the lack of markets. So he looked to the Orient
20160	as well as to Europe as an outlet for the surplus of the farms. He sent
20161	agents to China and Japan to discover what American goods and produce
20162	those countries would consume and what manufactures they had to offer to
20163	Americans in exchange. To open the Pacific trade he bought two ocean
20164	monsters, the _Minnesota_ and the _Dakota_, thus preparing for
20165	emergencies West as well as East. When some Japanese came to the United
20166	States on their way to Europe to buy steel rails, Hill showed them how
20167	easy it was for them to make their purchase in this country and ship by
20168	way of American railways and American vessels. So the railway builder
20169	and promoter, who helped to break the virgin soil of the prairies, lived
20170	through the pioneer epoch and into the age of great finance. Before he
20171	died he saw the wheat fields of North Dakota linked with the spinning
20172	jennies of Manchester and the docks of Yokohama.
20173	
20174	
20175	THE EVOLUTION OF GRAZING AND AGRICULTURE
20176	
20177	=The Removal of the Indians.=--Unlike the frontier of New England in
20178	colonial days or that of Kentucky later, the advancing lines of home
20179	builders in the Far West had little difficulty with warlike natives.
20180	Indian attacks were made on the railway construction gangs; General
20181	Custer had his fatal battle with the Sioux in 1876 and there were minor
20182	brushes; but they were all of relatively slight consequence. The former
20183	practice of treating with the Indians as independent nations was
20184	abandoned in 1871 and most of them were concentrated in reservations
20185	where they were mainly supported by the government. The supervision of
20186	their affairs was vested in a board of commissioners created in 1869 and
20187	instructed to treat them as wards of the nation--a trust which
20188	unfortunately was often betrayed. A further step in Indian policy was
20189	taken in 1887 when provision was made for issuing lands to individual
20190	Indians, thus permitting them to become citizens and settle down among
20191	their white neighbors as farmers or cattle raisers. The disappearance of
20192	the buffalo, the main food supply of the wild Indians, had made them
20193	more tractable and more willing to surrender the freedom of the hunter
20194	for the routine of the reservation, ranch, or wheat field.
20195	
20196	=The Cowboy and Cattle Ranger.=--Between the frontier of farms and the
20197	mountains were plains and semi-arid regions in vast reaches suitable for
20198	grazing. As soon as the railways were open into the Missouri Valley,
20199	affording an outlet for stock, there sprang up to the westward cattle
20200	and sheep raising on an immense scale. The far-famed American cowboy was
20201	the hero in this scene. Great herds of cattle were bred in Texas; with
20202	the advancing spring and summer seasons, they were driven northward
20203	across the plains and over the buffalo trails. In a single year, 1884,
20204	it is estimated that nearly one million head of cattle were moved out of
20205	Texas to the North by four thousand cowboys, supplied with 30,000
20206	horses and ponies.
20207	
20208	During the two decades from 1870 to 1890 both the cattle men and the
20209	sheep raisers had an almost free run of the plains, using public lands
20210	without paying for the privilege and waging war on one another over the
20211	possession of ranges. At length, however, both had to go, as the
20212	homesteaders and land companies came and fenced in the plain and desert
20213	with endless lines of barbed wire. Already in 1893 a writer familiar
20214	with the frontier lamented the passing of the picturesque days: "The
20215	unique position of the cowboys among the Americans is jeopardized in a
20216	thousand ways. Towns are growing up on their pasture lands; irrigation
20217	schemes of a dozen sorts threaten to turn bunch-grass scenery into
20218	farm-land views; farmers are pre-empting valleys and the sides of
20219	waterways; and the day is not far distant when stock-raising must be
20220	done mainly in small herds, with winter corrals, and then the cowboy's
20221	days will end. Even now his condition disappoints those who knew him
20222	only half a dozen years ago. His breed seems to have deteriorated and
20223	his ranks are filling with men who work for wages rather than for the
20224	love of the free life and bold companionship that once tempted men into
20225	that calling. Splendid Cheyenne saddles are less and less numerous in
20226	the outfits; the distinctive hat that made its way up from Mexico may or
20227	may not be worn; all the civil authorities in nearly all towns in the
20228	grazing country forbid the wearing of side arms; nobody shoots up these
20229	towns any more. The fact is the old simon-pure cowboy days are gone
20230	already."
20231	
20232	=Settlement under the Homestead Act of 1862.=--Two factors gave a
20233	special stimulus to the rapid settlement of Western lands which swept
20234	away the Indians and the cattle rangers. The first was the policy of the
20235	railway companies in selling large blocks of land received from the
20236	government at low prices to induce immigration. The second was the
20237	operation of the Homestead law passed in 1862. This measure practically
20238	closed the long controversy over the disposition of the public domain
20239	that was suitable for agriculture. It provided for granting, without any
20240	cost save a small registration fee, public lands in lots of 160 acres
20241	each to citizens and aliens who declared their intention of becoming
20242	citizens. The one important condition attached was that the settler
20243	should occupy the farm for five years before his title was finally
20244	confirmed. Even this stipulation was waived in the case of the Civil War
20245	veterans who were allowed to count their term of military service as a
20246	part of the five years' occupancy required. As the soldiers of the
20247	Revolutionary and Mexican wars had advanced in great numbers to the
20248	frontier in earlier days, so now veterans led in the settlement of the
20249	middle border. Along with them went thousands of German, Irish, and
20250	Scandinavian immigrants, fresh from the Old World. Between 1867 and
20251	1874, 27,000,000 acres were staked out in quarter-section farms. In
20252	twenty years (1860-80), the population of Nebraska leaped from 28,000 to
20253	almost half a million; Kansas from 100,000 to a million; Iowa from
20254	600,000 to 1,600,000; and the Dakotas from 5000 to 140,000.
20255	
20256	=The Diversity of Western Agriculture.=--In soil, produce, and
20257	management, Western agriculture presented many contrasts to that of the
20258	East and South. In the region of arable and watered lands the typical
20259	American unit--the small farm tilled by the owner--appeared as usual;
20260	but by the side of it many a huge domain owned by foreign or Eastern
20261	companies and tilled by hired labor. Sometimes the great estate took the
20262	shape of the "bonanza farm" devoted mainly to wheat and corn and
20263	cultivated on a large scale by machinery. Again it assumed the form of
20264	the cattle ranch embracing tens of thousands of acres. Again it was a
20265	vast holding of diversified interest, such as the Santa Anita ranch near
20266	Los Angeles, a domain of 60,000 acres "cultivated in a glorious sweep of
20267	vineyards and orange and olive orchards, rich sheep and cattle pastures
20268	and horse ranches, their life and customs handed down from the Spanish
20269	owners of the various ranches which were swept into one estate."
20270	
20271	=Irrigation.=--In one respect agriculture in the Far West was unique. In
20272	a large area spreading through eight states, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,
20273	Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of adjoining
20274	states, the rainfall was so slight that the ordinary crops to which the
20275	American farmer was accustomed could not be grown at all. The Mormons
20276	were the first Anglo-Saxons to encounter aridity, and they were baffled
20277	at first; but they studied it and mastered it by magnificent irrigation
20278	systems. As other settlers poured into the West the problem of the
20279	desert was attacked with a will, some of them replying to the
20280	commiseration of Eastern farmers by saying that it was easier to scoop
20281	out an irrigation ditch than to cut forests and wrestle with stumps and
20282	stones. Private companies bought immense areas at low prices, built
20283	irrigation works, and disposed of their lands in small plots. Some
20284	ranchers with an instinct for water, like that of the miner for metal,
20285	sank wells into the dry sand and were rewarded with gushers that "soused
20286	the thirsty desert and turned its good-for-nothing sand into
20287	good-for-anything loam." The federal government came to the aid of the
20288	arid regions in 1894 by granting lands to the states to be used for
20289	irrigation purposes. In this work Wyoming took the lead with a law which
20290	induced capitalists to invest in irrigation and at the same time
20291	provided for the sale of the redeemed lands to actual settlers. Finally
20292	in 1902 the federal government by its liberal Reclamation Act added its
20293	strength to that of individuals, companies, and states in conquering
20294	"arid America."
20295	
20296	"Nowhere," writes Powell, a historian of the West, in his picturesque
20297	_End of the Trail_, "has the white man fought a more courageous fight or
20298	won a more brilliant victory than in Arizona. His weapons have been the
20299	transit and the level, the drill and the dredge, the pick and the spade;
20300	and the enemy which he has conquered has been the most stubborn of all
20301	foes--the hostile forces of Nature.... The story of how the white man
20302	within the space of less than thirty years penetrated, explored, and
20303	mapped this almost unknown region; of how he carried law, order, and
20304	justice into a section which had never had so much as a speaking
20305	acquaintance with any one of the three before; of how, realizing the
20306	necessity for means of communication, he built highways of steel across
20307	this territory from east to west and from north to south; of how,
20308	undismayed by the savageness of the countenance which the desert turned
20309	upon him, he laughed and rolled up his sleeves, and spat upon his hands,
20310	and slashed the face of the desert with canals and irrigating ditches,
20311	and filled those ditches with water brought from deep in the earth or
20312	high in the mountains; and of how, in the conquered and submissive soil,
20313	he replaced the aloe with alfalfa, the mesquite with maize, the cactus
20314	with cotton, forms one of the most inspiring chapters in our history. It
20315	is one of the epics of civilization, this reclamation of the Southwest,
20316	and its heroes, thank God, are Americans.
20317	
20318	"Other desert regions have been redeemed by irrigation--Egypt, for
20319	example, and Mesopotamia and parts of the Sudan--but the people of all
20320	those regions lay stretched out in the shade of a convenient palm,
20321	metaphorically speaking, and waited for some one with more energy than
20322	themselves to come along and do the work. But the Arizonians, mindful of
20323	the fact that God, the government, and Carnegie help those who help
20324	themselves, spent their days wielding the pick and shovel, and their
20325	evenings in writing letters to Washington with toil-hardened hands.
20326	After a time the government was prodded into action and the great dams
20327	at Laguna and Roosevelt are the result. Then the people, organizing
20328	themselves into cooperative leagues and water-users' associations, took
20329	up the work of reclamation where the government left off; it is to these
20330	energetic, persevering men who have drilled wells, plowed fields, and
20331	dug ditches through the length and breadth of that great region which
20332	stretches from Yuma to Tucson, that the metamorphosis of Arizona is
20333	due."
20334	
20335	The effect of irrigation wherever introduced was amazing. Stretches of
20336	sand and sagebrush gave way to fertile fields bearing crops of wheat,
20337	corn, fruits, vegetables, and grass. Huge ranches grazed by browsing
20338	sheep were broken up into small plots. The cowboy and ranchman vanished.
20339	In their place rose the prosperous community--a community unlike the
20340	township of Iowa or the industrial center of the East. Its intensive
20341	tillage left little room for hired labor. Its small holdings drew
20342	families together in village life rather than dispersing them on the
20343	lonely plain. Often the development of water power in connection with
20344	irrigation afforded electricity for labor-saving devices and lifted many
20345	a burden that in other days fell heavily upon the shoulders of the
20346	farmer and his family.
20347	
20348	
20349	MINING AND MANUFACTURING IN THE WEST
20350	
20351	=Mineral Resources.=--In another important particular the Far West
20352	differed from the Mississippi Valley states. That was in the
20353	predominance of mining over agriculture throughout a vast section.
20354	Indeed it was the minerals rather than the land that attracted the
20355	pioneers who first opened the country. The discovery of gold in
20356	California in 1848 was the signal for the great rush of prospectors,
20357	miners, and promoters who explored the valleys, climbed the hills,
20358	washed the sands, and dug up the soil in their feverish search for gold,
20359	silver, copper, coal, and other minerals. In Nevada and Montana the
20360	development of mineral resources went on all during the Civil War. Alder
20361	Gulch became Virginia City in 1863; Last Chance Gulch was named Helena
20362	in 1864; and Confederate Gulch was christened Diamond City in 1865. At
20363	Butte the miners began operations in 1864 and within five years had
20364	washed out eight million dollars' worth of gold. Under the gold they
20365	found silver; under silver they found copper.
20366	
20367	Even at the end of the nineteenth century, after agriculture was well
20368	advanced and stock and sheep raising introduced on a large scale,
20369	minerals continued to be the chief source of wealth in a number of
20370	states. This was revealed by the figures for 1910. The gold, silver,
20371	iron, and copper of Colorado were worth more than the wheat, corn, and
20372	oats combined; the copper of Montana sold for more than all the cereals
20373	and four times the price of the wheat. The interest of Nevada was also
20374	mainly mining, the receipts from the mineral output being $43,000,000 or
20375	more than one-half the national debt of Hamilton's day. The yield of the
20376	mines of Utah was worth four or five times the wheat crop; the coal of
20377	Wyoming brought twice as much as the great wool clip; the minerals of
20378	Arizona were totaled at $43,000,000 as against a wool clip reckoned at
20379	$1,200,000; while in Idaho alone of this group of states did the wheat
20380	crop exceed in value the output of the mines.
20381	
20382	[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._

20384	LOGGING]
20385	
20386	=Timber Resources.=--The forests of the great West, unlike those of the
20387	Ohio Valley, proved a boon to the pioneers rather than a foe to be
20388	attacked. In Ohio and Indiana, for example, the frontier line of
20389	homemakers had to cut, roll, and burn thousands of trees before they
20390	could put out a crop of any size. Beyond the Mississippi, however,
20391	there were all ready for the breaking plow great reaches of almost
20392	treeless prairie, where every stick of timber was precious. In the other
20393	parts, often rough and mountainous, where stood primeval forests of the
20394	finest woods, the railroads made good use of the timber. They consumed
20395	acres of forests themselves in making ties, bridge timbers, and
20396	telegraph poles, and they laid a heavy tribute upon the forests for
20397	their annual upkeep. The surplus trees, such as had burdened the
20398	pioneers of the Northwest Territory a hundred years before, they carried
20399	off to markets on the east and west coasts.
20400	
20401	=Western Industries.=--The peculiar conditions of the Far West
20402	stimulated a rise of industries more rapid than is usual in new country.
20403	The mining activities which in many sections preceded agriculture called
20404	for sawmills to furnish timber for the mines and smelters to reduce and
20405	refine ores. The ranches supplied sheep and cattle for the packing
20406	houses of Kansas City as well as Chicago. The waters of the Northwest
20407	afforded salmon for 4000 cases in 1866 and for 1,400,000 cases in 1916.
20408	The fruits and vegetables of California brought into existence
20409	innumerable canneries. The lumber industry, starting with crude sawmills
20410	to furnish rough timbers for railways and mines, ended in specialized
20411	factories for paper, boxes, and furniture. As the railways preceded
20412	settlement and furnished a ready outlet for local manufactures, so they
20413	encouraged the early establishment of varied industries, thus creating a
20414	state of affairs quite unlike that which obtained in the Ohio Valley in
20415	the early days before the opening of the Erie Canal.
20416	
20417	=Social Effects of Economic Activities.=--In many respects the social
20418	life of the Far West also differed from that of the Ohio Valley. The
20419	treeless prairies, though open to homesteads, favored the great estate
20420	tilled in part by tenant labor and in part by migratory seasonal labor,
20421	summoned from all sections of the country for the harvests. The mineral
20422	resources created hundreds of huge fortunes which made the accumulations
20423	of eastern mercantile families look trivial by comparison. Other
20424	millionaires won their fortunes in the railway business and still more
20425	from the cattle and sheep ranges. In many sections the "cattle king," as
20426	he was called, was as dominant as the planter had been in the old South.
20427	Everywhere in the grazing country he was a conspicuous and important
20428	person. He "sometimes invested money in banks, in railroad stocks, or in
20429	city property.... He had his rating in the commercial reviews and could
20430	hobnob with bankers, railroad presidents, and metropolitan merchants....
20431	He attended party caucuses and conventions, ran for the state
20432	legislature, and sometimes defeated a lawyer or metropolitan 'business
20433	man' in the race for a seat in Congress. In proportion to their numbers,
20434	the ranchers ... have constituted a highly impressive class."
20435	
20436	Although many of the early capitalists of the great West, especially
20437	from Nevada, spent their money principally in the East, others took
20438	leadership in promoting the sections in which they had made their
20439	fortunes. A railroad pioneer, General Palmer, built his home at Colorado
20440	Springs, founded the town, and encouraged local improvements. Denver
20441	owed its first impressive buildings to the civic patriotism of Horace
20442	Tabor, a wealthy mine owner. Leland Stanford paid his tribute to
20443	California in the endowment of a large university. Colonel W.F. Cody,
20444	better known as "Buffalo Bill," started his career by building a "boom
20445	town" which collapsed, and made a large sum of money supplying buffalo
20446	meat to construction hands (hence his popular name). By his famous Wild
20447	West Show, he increased it to a fortune which he devoted mainly to the
20448	promotion of a western reclamation scheme.
20449	
20450	While the Far West was developing this vigorous, aggressive leadership
20451	in business, a considerable industrial population was springing up. Even
20452	the cattle ranges and hundreds of farms were conducted like factories in
20453	that they were managed through overseers who hired plowmen, harvesters,
20454	and cattlemen at regular wages. At the same time there appeared other
20455	peculiar features which made a lasting impression on western economic
20456	life. Mining, lumbering, and fruit growing, for instance, employed
20457	thousands of workers during the rush months and turned them out at other
20458	times. The inevitable result was an army of migratory laborers wandering
20459	from camp to camp, from town to town, and from ranch to ranch, without
20460	fixed homes or established habits of life. From this extraordinary
20461	condition there issued many a long and lawless conflict between capital
20462	and labor, giving a distinct color to the labor movement in whole
20463	sections of the mountain and coast states.
20464	
20465	
20466	THE ADMISSION OF NEW STATES
20467	
20468	=The Spirit of Self-Government.=--The instinct of self-government was
20469	strong in the western communities. In the very beginning, it led to the
20470	organization of volunteer committees, known as "vigilantes," to suppress
20471	crime and punish criminals. As soon as enough people were settled
20472	permanently in a region, they took care to form a more stable kind of
20473	government. An illustration of this process is found in the Oregon
20474	compact made by the pioneers in 1843, the spirit of which is reflected
20475	in an editorial in an old copy of the _Rocky Mountain News_: "We claim
20476	that any body or community of American citizens which from any cause or
20477	under any circumstances is cut off from or from isolation is so situated
20478	as not to be under any active and protecting branch of the central
20479	government, have a right, if on American soil, to frame a government and
20480	enact such laws and regulations as may be necessary for their own
20481	safety, protection, and happiness, always with the condition precedent,
20482	that they shall, at the earliest moment when the central government
20483	shall extend an effective organization and laws over them, give it their
20484	unqualified support and obedience."
20485	
20486	People who turned so naturally to the organization of local
20487	administration were equally eager for admission to the union as soon as
20488	any shadow of a claim to statehood could be advanced. As long as a
20489	region was merely one of the territories of the United States, the
20490	appointment of the governor and other officers was controlled by
20491	politics at Washington. Moreover the disposition of land, mineral
20492	rights, forests, and water power was also in the hands of national
20493	leaders. Thus practical considerations were united with the spirit of
20494	independence in the quest for local autonomy.
20495	
20496	=Nebraska and Colorado.=--Two states, Nebraska and Colorado, had little
20497	difficulty in securing admission to the union. The first, Nebraska, had
20498	been organized as a territory by the famous Kansas-Nebraska bill which
20499	did so much to precipitate the Civil War. Lying to the north of Kansas,
20500	which had been admitted in 1861, it escaped the invasion of slave owners
20501	from Missouri and was settled mainly by farmers from the North. Though
20502	it claimed a population of only 67,000, it was regarded with kindly
20503	interest by the Republican Congress at Washington and, reduced to its
20504	present boundaries, it received the coveted statehood in 1867.
20505	
20506	This was hardly accomplished before the people of Colorado to the
20507	southwest began to make known their demands. They had been organized
20508	under territorial government in 1861 when they numbered only a handful;
20509	but within ten years the aspect of their affairs had completely changed.
20510	The silver and gold deposits of the Leadville and Cripple Creek regions
20511	had attracted an army of miners and prospectors. The city of Denver,
20512	founded in 1858 and named after the governor of Kansas whence came many
20513	of the early settlers, had grown from a straggling camp of log huts into
20514	a prosperous center of trade. By 1875 it was reckoned that the
20515	population of the territory was not less than one hundred thousand; the
20516	following year Congress, yielding to the popular appeal, made Colorado a
20517	member of the American union.
20518	
20519	=Six New States (1889-1890).=--For many years there was a deadlock in
20520	Congress over the admission of new states. The spell was broken in 1889
20521	under the leadership of the Dakotas. For a long time the Dakota
20522	territory, organized in 1861, had been looked upon as the home of the
20523	powerful Sioux Indians whose enormous reservation blocked the advance of
20524	the frontier. The discovery of gold in the Black Hills, however, marked
20525	their doom. Even before Congress could open their lands to prospectors,
20526	pioneers were swarming over the country. Farmers from the adjoining
20527	Minnesota and the Eastern states, Scandinavians, Germans, and Canadians,
20528	came in swelling waves to occupy the fertile Dakota lands, now famous
20529	even as far away as the fjords of Norway. Seldom had the plow of man cut
20530	through richer soil than was found in the bottoms of the Red River
20531	Valley, and it became all the more precious when the opening of the
20532	Northern Pacific in 1883 afforded a means of transportation east and
20533	west. The population, which had numbered 135,000 in 1880, passed the
20534	half million mark before ten years had elapsed.
20535	
20536	Remembering that Nebraska had been admitted with only 67,000
20537	inhabitants, the Dakotans could not see why they should be kept under
20538	federal tutelage. At the same time Washington, far away on the Pacific
20539	Coast, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, boasting of their populations and
20540	their riches, put in their own eloquent pleas. But the members of
20541	Congress were busy with politics. The Democrats saw no good reason for
20542	admitting new Republican states until after their defeat in 1888. Near
20543	the end of their term the next year they opened the door for North and
20544	South Dakota, Washington, and Montana. In 1890, a Republican Congress
20545	brought Idaho and Wyoming into the union, the latter with woman
20546	suffrage, which had been granted twenty-one years before.
20547	
20548	=Utah.=--Although Utah had long presented all the elements of a
20549	well-settled and industrious community, its admission to the union was
20550	delayed on account of popular hostility to the practice of polygamy. The
20551	custom, it is true, had been prohibited by act of Congress in 1862; but
20552	the law had been systematically evaded. In 1882 Congress made another
20553	and more effective effort to stamp out polygamy. Five years later it
20554	even went so far as to authorize the confiscation of the property of the
20555	Mormon Church in case the practice of plural marriages was not stopped.
20556	Meanwhile the Gentile or non-Mormon population was steadily increasing
20557	and the leaders in the Church became convinced that the battle
20558	against the sentiment of the country was futile. At last in 1896 Utah
20559	was admitted as a state under a constitution which forbade plural
20560	marriages absolutely and forever. Horace Greeley, who visited Utah in
20561	1859, had prophesied that the Pacific Railroad would work a revolution
20562	in the land of Brigham Young. His prophecy had come true.
20563	
20564	[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1912]
20565	
20566	=Rounding out the Continent.=--Three more territories now remained out
20567	of the Union. Oklahoma, long an Indian reservation, had been opened for
20568	settlement to white men in 1889. The rush upon the fertile lands of this
20569	region, the last in the history of America, was marked by all the frenzy
20570	of the final, desperate chance. At a signal from a bugle an army of men
20571	with families in wagons, men and women on horseback and on foot, burst
20572	into the territory. During the first night a city of tents was raised at
20573	Guthrie and Oklahoma City. In ten days wooden houses rose on the plains.
20574	In a single year there were schools, churches, business blocks, and
20575	newspapers. Within fifteen years there was a population of more than
20576	half a million. To the west, Arizona with a population of about 125,000
20577	and New Mexico with 200,000 inhabitants joined Oklahoma in asking for
20578	statehood. Congress, then Republican, looked with reluctance upon the
20579	addition of more Democratic states; but in 1907 it was literally
20580	compelled by public sentiment and a sense of justice to admit Oklahoma.
20581	In 1910 the House of Representatives went to the Democrats and within
20582	two years Arizona and New Mexico were "under the roof." So the
20583	continental domain was rounded out.
20584	
20585	
20586	THE INFLUENCE OF THE FAR WEST ON NATIONAL LIFE
20587	
20588	=The Last of the Frontier.=--When Horace Greeley made his trip west in
20589	1859 he thus recorded the progress of civilization in his journal:
20590	
20591	     "May 12th, Chicago.--Chocolate and morning journals last
20592	     seen on the hotel breakfast table.
20593	
20594	     23rd, Leavenworth (Kansas).--Room bells and bath tubs make
20595	     their final appearance.
20596	
20597	     26th, Manhattan.--Potatoes and eggs last recognized among
20598	     the blessings that 'brighten as they take their flight.'
20599	
20600	     27th, Junction City.--Last visitation of a boot-black, with
20601	     dissolving views of a board bedroom. Beds bid us good-by."

20605	THE CANADIAN BUILDING AT THE PANAMA-CALIFORNIA INTERNATIONAL
20606	EXPOSITION, SAN DIEGO, 1915]
20607	
20608	Within thirty years travelers were riding across that country in Pullman
20609	cars and enjoying at the hotels all the comforts of a standardized
20610	civilization. The "wild west" was gone, and with it that frontier of
20611	pioneers and settlers who had long given such a bent and tone to
20612	American life and had "poured in upon the floor of Congress" such a long
20613	line of "backwoods politicians," as they were scornfully styled.
20614	
20615	=Free Land and Eastern Labor.=--It was not only the picturesque features
20616	of the frontier that were gone. Of far more consequence was the
20617	disappearance of free lands with all that meant for American labor. For
20618	more than a hundred years, any man of even moderate means had been able
20619	to secure a homestead of his own and an independent livelihood. For a
20620	hundred years America had been able to supply farms to as many
20621	immigrants as cared to till the soil. Every new pair of strong arms
20622	meant more farms and more wealth. Workmen in Eastern factories, mines,
20623	or mills who did not like their hours, wages, or conditions of labor,
20624	could readily find an outlet to the land. Now all that was over. By
20625	about 1890 most of the desirable land available under the Homestead act
20626	had disappeared. American industrial workers confronted a new situation.
20627	
20628	=Grain Supplants King Cotton.=--In the meantime a revolution was taking
20629	place in agriculture. Until 1860 the chief staples sold by America were
20630	cotton and tobacco. With the advance of the frontier, corn and wheat
20631	supplanted them both in agrarian economy. The West became the granary of
20632	the East and of Western Europe. The scoop shovel once used to handle
20633	grain was superseded by the towering elevator, loading and unloading
20634	thousands of bushels every hour. The refrigerator car and ship made the
20635	packing industry as stable as the production of cotton or corn, and gave
20636	an immense impetus to cattle raising and sheep farming. So the meat of
20637	the West took its place on the English dinner table by the side of bread
20638	baked from Dakotan wheat.
20639	
20640	=Aid in American Economic Independence.=--The effects of this economic
20641	movement were manifold and striking. Billions of dollars' worth of
20642	American grain, dairy produce, and meat were poured into European
20643	markets where they paid off debts due money lenders and acquired
20644	capital to develop American resources. Thus they accelerated the
20645	progress of American financiers toward national independence. The
20646	country, which had timidly turned to the Old World for capital in
20647	Hamilton's day and had borrowed at high rates of interest in London in
20648	Lincoln's day, moved swiftly toward the time when it would be among the
20649	world's first bankers and money lenders itself. Every grain of wheat and
20650	corn pulled the balance down on the American side of the scale.
20651	
20652	=Eastern Agriculture Affected.=--In the East as well as abroad the
20653	opening of the western granary produced momentous results. The
20654	agricultural economy of that part of the country was changed in many
20655	respects. Whole sections of the poorest land went almost out of
20656	cultivation, the abandoned farms of the New England hills bearing solemn
20657	witness to the competing power of western wheat fields. Sheep and cattle
20658	raising, as well as wheat and corn production, suffered at least a
20659	relative decline. Thousands of farmers cultivating land of the lower
20660	grade were forced to go West or were driven to the margin of
20661	subsistence. Even the herds that supplied Eastern cities with milk were
20662	fed upon grain brought halfway across the continent.
20663	
20664	=The Expansion of the American Market.=--Upon industry as well as
20665	agriculture, the opening of vast food-producing regions told in a
20666	thousand ways. The demand for farm machinery, clothing, boots, shoes,
20667	and other manufactures gave to American industries such a market as even
20668	Hamilton had never foreseen. Moreover it helped to expand far into the
20669	Mississippi Valley the industrial area once confined to the Northern
20670	seaboard states and to transform the region of the Great Lakes into an
20671	industrial empire. Herein lies the explanation of the growth of
20672	mid-western cities after 1865. Chicago, with its thirty-five railways,
20673	tapped every locality of the West and South. To the railways were added
20674	the water routes of the Lakes, thus creating a strategic center for
20675	industries. Long foresight carried the McCormick reaper works to
20676	Chicago before 1860. From Troy, New York, went a large stove plant. That
20677	was followed by a shoe factory from Massachusetts. The packing industry
20678	rose as a matter of course at a point so advantageous for cattle raisers
20679	and shippers and so well connected with Eastern markets.
20680	
20681	To the opening of the Far West also the Lake region was indebted for a
20682	large part of that water-borne traffic which made it "the Mediterranean
20683	basin of North America." The produce of the West and the manufactures of
20684	the East poured through it in an endless stream. The swift growth of
20685	shipbuilding on the Great Lakes helped to compensate for the decline of
20686	the American marine on the high seas. In response to this stimulus
20687	Detroit could boast that her shipwrights were able to turn out a ten
20688	thousand ton Leviathan for ore or grain about "as quickly as carpenters
20689	could put up an eight-room house." Thus in relation to the Far West the
20690	old Northwest territory--the wilderness of Jefferson's time--had taken
20691	the position formerly occupied by New England alone. It was supplying
20692	capital and manufactures for a vast agricultural empire West and South.
20693	
20694	=America on the Pacific.=--It has been said that the Mediterranean Sea
20695	was the center of ancient civilization; that modern civilization has
20696	developed on the shores of the Atlantic; and that the future belongs to
20697	the Pacific. At any rate, the sweep of the United States to the shores
20698	of the Pacific quickly exercised a powerful influence on world affairs
20699	and it undoubtedly has a still greater significance for the future.
20700	
20701	Very early regular traffic sprang up between the Pacific ports and the
20702	Hawaiian Islands, China, and Japan. Two years before the adjustment of
20703	the Oregon controversy with England, namely in 1844, the United States
20704	had established official and trading relations with China. Ten years
20705	later, four years after the admission of California to the union, the
20706	barred door of Japan was forced open by Commodore Perry. The commerce
20707	which had long before developed between the Pacific ports and Hawaii,
20708	China, and Japan now flourished under official care. In 1865 a ship
20709	from Honolulu carried sugar, molasses, and fruits from Hawaii to the
20710	Oregon port of Astoria. The next year a vessel from Hongkong brought
20711	rice, mats, and tea from China. An era of lucrative trade was opened.
20712	The annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the addition of the Philippines at the
20713	same time, and the participation of American troops in the suppression
20714	of the Boxer rebellion in Peking in 1900, were but signs and symbols of
20715	American power on the Pacific.

20720	
20721	=Conservation and the Land Problem.=--The disappearance of the frontier
20722	also brought new and serious problems to the governments of the states
20723	and the nation. The people of the whole United States suddenly were
20724	forced to realize that there was a limit to the rich, new land to
20725	exploit and to the forests and minerals awaiting the ax and the pick.
20726	Then arose in America the questions which had long perplexed the
20727	countries of the Old World--the scientific use of the soils and
20728	conservation of natural resources. Hitherto the government had followed
20729	the easy path of giving away arable land and selling forest and mineral
20730	lands at low prices. Now it had to face far more difficult and complex
20731	problems. It also had to consider questions of land tenure again,
20732	especially if the ideal of a nation of home-owning farmers was to be
20733	maintained. While there was plenty of land for every man or woman who
20734	wanted a home on the soil, it made little difference if single landlords
20735	or companies got possession of millions of acres, if a hundred men in
20736	one western river valley owned 17,000,000 acres; but when the good land
20737	for small homesteads was all gone, then was raised the real issue. At
20738	the opening of the twentieth century the nation, which a hundred years
20739	before had land and natural resources apparently without limit, was
20740	compelled to enact law after law conserving its forests and minerals.
20741	Then it was that the great state of California, on the very border of
20742	the continent, felt constrained to enact a land settlement measure
20743	providing government assistance in an effort to break up large holdings
20744	into small lots and to make it easy for actual settlers to acquire small
20745	farms. America was passing into a new epoch.

20839	CHAPTER XIX
20840	
20841	DOMESTIC ISSUES BEFORE THE COUNTRY (1865-1897)
20842	
20843	
20844	For thirty years after the Civil War the leading political parties,
20845	although they engaged in heated presidential campaigns, were not sharply
20846	and clearly opposed on many matters of vital significance. During none
20847	of that time was there a clash of opinion over specific issues such as
20848	rent the country in 1800 when Jefferson rode a popular wave to victory,
20849	or again in 1828 when Jackson's western hordes came sweeping into power.
20850	The Democrats, who before 1860 definitely opposed protective tariffs,
20851	federal banking, internal improvements, and heavy taxes, now spoke
20852	cautiously on all these points. The Republicans, conscious of the fact
20853	that they had been a minority of the voters in 1860 and warned by the
20854	early loss of the House of Representatives in 1874, also moved with
20855	considerable prudence among the perplexing problems of the day. Again
20856	and again the votes in Congress showed that no clear line separated all
20857	the Democrats from all the Republicans. There were Republicans who
20858	favored tariff reductions and "cheap money." There were Democrats who
20859	looked with partiality upon high protection or with indulgence upon the
20860	contraction of the currency. Only on matters relating to the coercion of
20861	the South was the division between the parties fairly definite; this
20862	could be readily accounted for on practical as well as sentimental
20863	grounds.
20864	
20865	After all, the vague criticisms and proposals that found their way into
20866	the political platforms did but reflect the confusion of mind prevailing
20867	in the country. The fact that, out of the eighteen years between 1875
20868	and 1893, the Democrats held the House of Representatives for fourteen
20869	years while the Republicans had every President but one showed that the
20870	voters, like the politicians, were in a state of indecision. Hayes had a
20871	Democratic House during his entire term and a Democratic Senate for two
20872	years of the four. Cleveland was confronted by a belligerent Republican
20873	majority in the Senate during his first administration; and at the same
20874	time was supported by a Democratic majority in the House. Harrison was
20875	sustained by continuous Republican successes in Senatorial elections;
20876	but in the House he had the barest majority from 1889 to 1891 and lost
20877	that altogether at the election held in the middle of his term. The
20878	opinion of the country was evidently unsettled and fluctuating. It was
20879	still distracted by memories of the dead past and uncertain as to the
20880	trend of the future.
20881	
20882	
20883	THE CURRENCY QUESTION
20884	
20885	Nevertheless these years of muddled politics and nebulous issues proved
20886	to be a period in which social forces were gathering for the great
20887	campaign of 1896. Except for three new features--the railways, the
20888	trusts, and the trade unions--the subjects of debate among the people
20889	were the same as those that had engaged their attention since the
20890	foundation of the republic: the currency, the national debt, banking,
20891	the tariff, and taxation.
20892	
20893	=Debtors and the Fall in Prices.=--For many reasons the currency
20894	question occupied the center of interest. As of old, the farmers and
20895	planters of the West and South were heavily in debt to the East for
20896	borrowed money secured by farm mortgages; and they counted upon the sale
20897	of cotton, corn, wheat, and hogs to meet interest and principal when
20898	due. During the war, the Western farmers had been able to dispose of
20899	their produce at high prices and thus discharge their debts with
20900	comparative ease; but after the war prices declined. Wheat that sold at
20901	two dollars a bushel in 1865 brought sixty-four cents twenty years
20902	later. The meaning of this for the farmers in debt--and nearly
20903	three-fourths of them were in that class--can be shown by a single
20904	illustration. A thousand-dollar mortgage on a Western farm could be paid
20905	off by five hundred bushels of wheat when prices were high; whereas it
20906	took about fifteen hundred bushels to pay the same debt when wheat was
20907	at the bottom of the scale. For the farmer, it must be remembered, wheat
20908	was the measure of his labor, the product of his toil under the summer
20909	sun; and in its price he found the test of his prosperity.
20910	
20911	=Creditors and Falling Prices.=--To the bondholders or creditors, on the
20912	other hand, falling prices were clear gain. If a fifty-dollar coupon on
20913	a bond bought seventy or eighty bushels of wheat instead of twenty or
20914	thirty, the advantage to the owner of the coupon was obvious. Moreover
20915	the advantage seemed to him entirely just. Creditors had suffered heavy
20916	losses when the Civil War carried prices skyward while the interest
20917	rates on their old bonds remained stationary. For example, if a man had
20918	a $1000 bond issued before 1860 and paying interest at five per cent, he
20919	received fifty dollars a year from it. Before the war each dollar would
20920	buy a bushel of wheat; in 1865 it would only buy half a bushel. When
20921	prices--that is, the cost of living--began to go down, creditors
20922	therefore generally regarded the change with satisfaction as a return to
20923	normal conditions.
20924	
20925	=The Cause of Falling Prices.=--The fall in prices was due, no doubt, to
20926	many factors. Among them must be reckoned the discontinuance of
20927	government buying for war purposes, labor-saving farm machinery,
20928	immigration, and the opening of new wheat-growing regions. The currency,
20929	too, was an element in the situation. Whatever the cause, the
20930	discontented farmers believed that the way to raise prices was to issue
20931	more money. They viewed it as a case of supply and demand. If there was
20932	a small volume of currency in circulation, prices would be low; if there
20933	was a large volume, prices would be high. Hence they looked with favor
20934	upon all plans to increase the amount of money in circulation. First
20935	they advocated more paper notes--greenbacks--and then they turned to
20936	silver as the remedy. The creditors, on the other hand, naturally
20937	approved the reduction of the volume of currency. They wished to see the
20938	greenbacks withdrawn from circulation and gold--a metal more limited in
20939	volume than silver--made the sole basis of the national monetary system.
20940	
20941	=The Battle over the Greenbacks.=--The contest between these factions
20942	began as early as 1866. In that year, Congress enacted a law authorizing
20943	the Treasury to withdraw the greenbacks from circulation. The paper
20944	money party set up a shrill cry of protest, and kept up the fight until,
20945	in 1878, it forced Congress to provide for the continuous re-issue of
20946	the legal tender notes as they came into the Treasury in payment of
20947	taxes and other dues. Then could the friends of easy money rejoice:
20948	
20949	    "Thou, Greenback, 'tis of thee
20950	     Fair money of the free,
20951	      Of thee we sing."
20952	
20953	=Resumption of Specie Payment.=--There was, however, another side to
20954	this victory. The opponents of the greenbacks, unable to stop the
20955	circulation of paper, induced Congress to pass a law in 1875 providing
20956	that on and after January 1, 1879, "the Secretary of the Treasury shall
20957	redeem in coin the United States legal tender notes then outstanding on
20958	their presentation at the office of the Assistant Treasurer of the
20959	United States in the City of New York in sums of not less than fifty
20960	dollars." "The way to resume," John Sherman had said, "is to resume."
20961	When the hour for redemption arrived, the Treasury was prepared with a
20962	large hoard of gold. "On the appointed day," wrote the assistant
20963	secretary, "anxiety reigned in the office of the Treasury. Hour after
20964	hour passed; no news from New York. Inquiry by wire showed that all was
20965	quiet. At the close of the day this message came: '$135,000 of notes
20966	presented for coin--$400,000 of gold for notes.' That was all.
20967	Resumption was accomplished with no disturbance. By five o'clock the
20968	news was all over the land, and the New York bankers were sipping their
20969	tea in absolute safety."
20970	
20971	=The Specie Problem--the Parity of Gold and Silver.=--Defeated in their
20972	efforts to stop "the present suicidal and destructive policy of
20973	contraction," the advocates of an abundant currency demanded an increase
20974	in the volume of silver in circulation. This precipitated one of the
20975	sharpest political battles in American history. The issue turned on
20976	legal as well as economic points. The Constitution gave Congress the
20977	power to coin money and it forbade the states to make anything but gold
20978	and silver legal tender in the payment of debts. It evidently
20979	contemplated the use of both metals in the currency system. Such, at
20980	least, was the view of many eminent statesmen, including no less a
20981	personage than James G. Blaine. The difficulty, however, lay in
20982	maintaining gold and silver coins on a level which would permit them to
20983	circulate with equal facility. Obviously, if the gold in a gold dollar
20984	exceeds the value of the silver in a silver dollar on the open market,
20985	men will hoard gold money and leave silver money in circulation. When,
20986	for example, Congress in 1792 fixed the ratio of the two metals at one
20987	to fifteen--one ounce of gold declared worth fifteen of silver--it was
20988	soon found that gold had been undervalued. When again in 1834 the ratio
20989	was put at one to sixteen, it was found that silver was undervalued.
20990	Consequently the latter metal was not brought in for coinage and silver
20991	almost dropped out of circulation. Many a silver dollar was melted down
20992	by silverware factories.
20993	
20994	=Silver Demonetized in 1873.=--So things stood in 1873. At that time,
20995	Congress, in enacting a mintage law, discontinued the coinage of the
20996	standard silver dollar, then practically out of circulation. This act
20997	was denounced later by the friends of silver as "the crime of '73," a
20998	conspiracy devised by the money power and secretly carried out. This
20999	contention the debates in Congress do not seem to sustain. In the course
21000	of the argument on the mint law it was distinctly said by one speaker at
21001	least: "This bill provides for the making of changes in the legal tender
21002	coin of the country and for substituting as legal tender, coin of only
21003	one metal instead of two as heretofore."
21004	
21005	=The Decline in the Value of Silver.=--Absorbed in the greenback
21006	controversy, the people apparently did not appreciate, at the time, the
21007	significance of the "demonetization" of silver; but within a few years
21008	several events united in making it the center of a political storm.
21009	Germany, having abandoned silver in 1871, steadily increased her demand
21010	for gold. Three years later, the countries of the Latin Union followed
21011	this example, thus helping to enhance the price of the yellow metal. All
21012	the while, new silver lodes, discovered in the Far West, were pouring
21013	into the market great streams of the white metal, bearing down the
21014	price. Then came the resumption of specie payment, which, in effect,
21015	placed the paper money on a gold basis. Within twenty years silver was
21016	worth in gold only about half the price of 1870.
21017	
21018	That there had been a real decline in silver was denied by the friends
21019	of that metal. They alleged that gold had gone up because it had been
21020	given a monopoly in the coinage markets of civilized governments. This
21021	monopoly, they continued, was the fruit of a conspiracy against the
21022	people conceived by the bankers of the world. Moreover, they went on,
21023	the placing of the greenbacks on a gold basis had itself worked a
21024	contraction of the currency; it lowered the prices of labor and produce
21025	to the advantage of the holders of long-term investments bearing a fixed
21026	rate of interest. When wheat sold at sixty-four cents a bushel, their
21027	search for relief became desperate, and they at last concentrated their
21028	efforts on opening the mints of the government for the free coinage of
21029	silver at the ratio of sixteen to one.
21030	
21031	=Republicans and Democrats Divided.=--On this question both Republicans
21032	and Democrats were divided, the line being drawn between the East on the
21033	one hand and the South and West on the other, rather than between the
21034	two leading parties. So trusted a leader as James G. Blaine avowed, in a
21035	speech delivered in the Senate in 1878, that, as the Constitution
21036	required Congress to make both gold and silver the money of the land,
21037	the only question left was that of fixing the ratio between them. He
21038	affirmed, moreover, the main contention of the silver faction that a
21039	reopening of the government mints of the world to silver would bring it
21040	up to its old relation with gold. He admitted also that their most
21041	ominous warnings were well founded, saying: "I believe the struggle now
21042	going on in this country and in other countries for a single gold
21043	standard would, if successful, produce widespread disaster throughout
21044	the commercial world. The destruction of silver as money and the
21045	establishment of gold as the sole unit of value must have a ruinous
21046	effect on all forms of property, except those investments which yield a
21047	fixed return."
21048	
21049	This was exactly the concession that the silver party wanted.
21050	"Three-fourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted
21051	on borrowed capital," said Senator Jones, of Nevada. "Three-fourths of
21052	the homes and farms that stand in the names of the actual occupants have
21053	been bought on time and a very large proportion of them are mortgaged
21054	for the payment of some part of the purchase money. Under the operation
21055	of a shrinkage in the volume of money, this enormous mass of borrowers,
21056	at the maturity of their respective debts, though nominally paying no
21057	more than the amount borrowed, with interest, are in reality, in the
21058	amount of the principal alone, returning a percentage of value greater
21059	than they received--more in equity than they contracted to pay.... In
21060	all discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside the
21061	equities involved by sneering at the debtors."
21062	
21063	=The Silver Purchase Act (1878).=--Even before the actual resumption of
21064	specie payment, the advocates of free silver were a power to be reckoned
21065	with, particularly in the Democratic party. They had a majority in the
21066	House of Representatives in 1878 and they carried a silver bill through
21067	that chamber. Blocked by the Republican Senate they accepted a
21068	compromise in the Bland-Allison bill, which provided for huge monthly
21069	purchases of silver by the government for coinage into dollars. So
21070	strong was the sentiment that a two-thirds majority was mustered after
21071	President Hayes vetoed the measure.
21072	
21073	The effect of this act, as some had anticipated, was disappointing. It
21074	did not stay silver on its downward course. Thereupon the silver faction
21075	pressed through Congress in 1886 a bill providing for the issue of paper
21076	certificates based on the silver accumulated in the Treasury. Still
21077	silver continued to fall. Then the advocates of inflation declared that
21078	they would be content with nothing short of free coinage at the ratio of
21079	sixteen to one. If the issue had been squarely presented in 1890, there
21080	is good reason for believing that free silver would have received a
21081	majority in both houses of Congress; but it was not presented.
21082	
21083	=The Sherman Silver Purchase Act and the Bond Sales.=--Republican
21084	leaders, particularly from the East, stemmed the silver tide by a
21085	diversion of forces. They passed the Sherman Act of 1890 providing for
21086	large monthly purchases of silver and for the issue of notes redeemable
21087	in gold or silver at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. In
21088	a clause of superb ambiguity they announced that it was "the established
21089	policy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with
21090	each other upon the present legal ratio or such other ratio as may be
21091	provided by law." For a while silver was buoyed up. Then it turned once
21092	more on its downward course. In the meantime the Treasury was in a sad
21093	plight. To maintain the gold reserve, President Cleveland felt compelled
21094	to sell government bonds; and to his dismay he found that as soon as the
21095	gold was brought in at the front door of the Treasury, notes were
21096	presented for redemption and the gold was quickly carried out at the
21097	back door. Alarmed at the vicious circle thus created, he urged upon
21098	Congress the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. For this he was
21099	roundly condemned by many of his own followers who branded his conduct
21100	as "treason to the party"; but the Republicans, especially from the
21101	East, came to his rescue and in 1893 swept the troublesome sections of
21102	the law from the statute book. The anger of the silver faction knew no
21103	bounds, and the leaders made ready for the approaching presidential
21104	campaign.
21105	
21106	
21107	THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF AND TAXATION
21108	
21109	=Fluctuation in Tariff Policy.=--As each of the old parties was divided
21110	on the currency question, it is not surprising that there was some
21111	confusion in their ranks over the tariff. Like the silver issue, the
21112	tariff tended to align the manufacturing East against the agricultural
21113	West and South rather than to cut directly between the two parties.
21114	Still the Republicans on the whole stood firmly by the rates imposed
21115	during the Civil War. If we except the reductions of 1872 which were
21116	soon offset by increases, we may say that those rates were substantially
21117	unchanged for nearly twenty years. When a revision was brought about,
21118	however, it was initiated by Republican leaders. Seeing a huge surplus
21119	of revenue in the Treasury in 1883, they anticipated popular clamor by
21120	revising the tariff on the theory that it ought to be reformed by its
21121	friends rather than by its enemies. On the other hand, it was the
21122	Republicans also who enacted the McKinley tariff bill of 1890, which
21123	carried protection to its highest point up to that time.
21124	
21125	The Democrats on their part were not all confirmed free traders or even
21126	advocates of tariff for revenue only. In Cleveland's first
21127	administration they did attack the protective system in the House, where
21128	they had a majority, and in this they were vigorously supported by the
21129	President. The assault, however, proved to be a futile gesture for it
21130	was blocked by the Republicans in the Senate. When, after the sweeping
21131	victory of 1892, the Democrats in the House again attempted to bring
21132	down the tariff by the Wilson bill of 1894, they were checkmated by
21133	their own party colleagues in the upper chamber. In the end they were
21134	driven into a compromise that looked more like a McKinley than a Calhoun
21135	tariff. The Republicans taunted them with being "babes in the woods."
21136	President Cleveland was so dissatisfied with the bill that he refused to
21137	sign it, allowing it to become a law, on the lapse of ten days, without
21138	his approval.
21139	
21140	=The Income Tax of 1894.=--The advocates of tariff reduction usually
21141	associated with their proposal a tax on incomes. The argument which
21142	they advanced in support of their program was simple. Most of the
21143	industries, they said, are in the East and the protective tariff which
21144	taxes consumers for the benefit of manufacturers is, in effect, a
21145	tribute laid upon the rest of the country. As an offset they offered a
21146	tax on large incomes; this owing to the heavy concentration of rich
21147	people in the East, would fall mainly upon the beneficiaries of
21148	protection. "We propose," said one of them, "to place a part of the
21149	burden upon the accumulated wealth of the country instead of placing it
21150	all upon the consumption of the people." In this spirit the sponsors of
21151	the Wilson tariff bill laid a tax upon all incomes of $4000 a year or
21152	more.
21153	
21154	In taking this step, the Democrats encountered opposition in their own
21155	party. Senator Hill, of New York, turned fiercely upon them, exclaiming:
21156	"The professors with their books, the socialists with their schemes, the
21157	anarchists with their bombs are all instructing the people in the ...
21158	principles of taxation." Even the Eastern Republicans were hardly as
21159	savage in their denunciation of the tax. But all this labor was wasted.
21160	The next year the Supreme Court of the United States declared the income
21161	tax to be a direct tax, and therefore null and void because it was laid
21162	on incomes wherever found and not apportioned among the states according
21163	to population. The fact that four of the nine judges dissented from this
21164	decision was also an index to the diversity of opinion that divided both
21165	parties.
21166	
21167	
21168	THE RAILWAYS AND TRUSTS
21169	
21170	=The Grangers and State Regulation.=--The same uncertainty about the
21171	railways and trusts pervaded the ranks of the Republicans and Democrats.
21172	As to the railways, the first firm and consistent demand for their
21173	regulation came from the West. There the farmers, in the early
21174	seventies, having got control in state legislatures, particularly in
21175	Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, enacted drastic laws prescribing the
21176	maximum charges which companies could make for carrying freight and
21177	passengers. The application of these measures, however, was limited
21178	because the state could not fix the rates for transporting goods and
21179	passengers beyond its own borders. The power of regulating interstate
21180	commerce, under the Constitution, belonged to Congress.
21181	
21182	=The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.=--Within a few years, the movement
21183	which had been so effective in western legislatures appeared at
21184	Washington in the form of demands for the federal regulation of
21185	interstate rates. In 1887, the pressure became so strong that Congress
21186	created the interstate commerce commission and forbade many abuses on
21187	the part of railways; such as discriminating in charges between one
21188	shipper and another and granting secret rebates to favored persons. This
21189	law was a significant beginning; but it left the main question of
21190	rate-fixing untouched, much to the discontent of farmers and shippers.
21191	
21192	=The Sherman Anti-Trust Law of 1890.=--As in the case of the railways,
21193	attacks upon the trusts were first made in state legislatures, where it
21194	became the fashion to provide severe penalties for those who formed
21195	monopolies and "conspired to enhance prices." Republicans and Democrats
21196	united in the promotion of measures of this kind. As in the case of the
21197	railways also, the movement to curb the trusts soon had spokesmen at
21198	Washington. Though Blaine had declared that "trusts were largely a
21199	private affair with which neither the President nor any private citizen
21200	had any particular right to interfere," it was a Republican Congress
21201	that enacted in 1890 the first measure--the Sherman Anti-Trust
21202	Law--directed against great combinations in business. This act declared
21203	illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise,
21204	or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the several
21205	states or with foreign nations."
21206	
21207	=The Futility of the Anti-Trust Law.=--Whether the Sherman law was
21208	directed against all combinations or merely those which placed an
21209	"unreasonable restraint" on trade and competition was not apparent.
21210	Senator Platt of Connecticut, a careful statesman of the old school,
21211	averred: "The questions of whether the bill would be operative, of how
21212	it would operate, or whether it was within the power of Congress to
21213	enact it, have been whistled down the wind in this Senate as idle talk
21214	and the whole effort has been to get some bill headed: 'A bill to punish
21215	trusts,' with which to go to the country." Whatever its purpose, its
21216	effect upon existing trusts and upon the formation of new combinations
21217	was negligible. It was practically unenforced by President Harrison and
21218	President Cleveland, in spite of the constant demand for harsh action
21219	against "monopolies." It was patent that neither the Republicans nor the
21220	Democrats were prepared for a war on the trusts to the bitter end.
21221	
21222	
21223	THE MINOR PARTIES AND UNREST
21224	
21225	=The Demands of Dissenting Parties.=--From the election of 1872, when
21226	Horace Greeley made his ill-fated excursion into politics, onward, there
21227	appeared in each presidential campaign one, and sometimes two or more
21228	parties, stressing issues that appealed mainly to wage-earners and
21229	farmers. Whether they chose to call themselves Labor Reformers,
21230	Greenbackers, or Anti-monopolists, their slogans and their platforms all
21231	pointed in one direction. Even the Prohibitionists, who in 1872 started
21232	on their career with a single issue, the abolition of the liquor
21233	traffic, found themselves making declarations of faith on other matters
21234	and hopelessly split over the money question in 1896.
21235	
21236	A composite view of the platforms put forth by the dissenting parties
21237	from the administration of Grant to the close of Cleveland's second term
21238	reveals certain notions common to them all. These included among many
21239	others: the earliest possible payment of the national debt; regulation
21240	of the rates of railways and telegraph companies; repeal of the specie
21241	resumption act of 1875; the issue of legal tender notes by the
21242	government convertible into interest-bearing obligations on demand;
21243	unlimited coinage of silver as well as gold; a graduated inheritance
21244	tax; legislation to take from "land, railroad, money, and other gigantic
21245	corporate monopolies ... the powers they have so corruptly and unjustly
21246	usurped"; popular or direct election of United States Senators; woman
21247	suffrage; and a graduated income tax, "placing the burden of government
21248	on those who can best afford to pay instead of laying it on the farmers
21249	and producers."
21250	
21251	=Criticism of the Old Parties.=--To this long program of measures the
21252	reformers added harsh and acrid criticism of the old parties and
21253	sometimes, it must be said, of established institutions of government.
21254	"We denounce," exclaimed the Labor party in 1888, "the Democratic and
21255	Republican parties as hopelessly and shamelessly corrupt and by reason
21256	of their affiliation with monopolies equally unworthy of the suffrages
21257	of those who do not live upon public plunder." "The United States
21258	Senate," insisted the Greenbackers, "is a body composed largely of
21259	aristocratic millionaires who according to their own party papers
21260	generally purchased their elections in order to protect the great
21261	monopolies which they represent." Indeed, if their platforms are to be
21262	accepted at face value, the Greenbackers believed that the entire
21263	government had passed out of the hands of the people.
21264	
21265	=The Grangers.=--This unsparing, not to say revolutionary, criticism of
21266	American political life, appealed, it seems, mainly to farmers in the
21267	Middle West. Always active in politics, they had, before the Civil War,
21268	cast their lot as a rule with one or the other of the leading parties.
21269	In 1867, however, there grew up among them an association known as the
21270	"Patrons of Husbandry," which was destined to play a large role in the
21271	partisan contests of the succeeding decades. This society, which
21272	organized local lodges or "granges" on principles of secrecy and
21273	fraternity, was originally designed to promote in a general way the
21274	interests of the farmers. Its political bearings were apparently not
21275	grasped at first by its promoters. Yet, appealing as it did to the most
21276	active and independent spirits among the farmers and gathering to itself
21277	the strength that always comes from organization, it soon found itself
21278	in the hands of leaders more or less involved in politics. Where a few
21279	votes are marshaled together in a democracy, there is power.
21280	
21281	=The Greenback Party.=--The first extensive activity of the Grangers was
21282	connected with the attack on the railways in the Middle West which
21283	forced several state legislatures to reduce freight and passenger rates
21284	by law. At the same time, some leaders in the movement, no doubt
21285	emboldened by this success, launched in 1876 a new political party,
21286	popularly known as the Greenbackers, favoring a continued re-issue of
21287	the legal tenders. The beginnings were disappointing; but two years
21288	later, in the congressional elections, the Greenbackers swept whole
21289	sections of the country. Their candidates polled more than a million
21290	votes and fourteen of them were returned to the House of
21291	Representatives. To all outward signs a new and formidable party had
21292	entered the lists.
21293	
21294	The sanguine hopes of the leaders proved to be illusory. The quiet
21295	operations of the resumption act the following year, a revival of
21296	industry from a severe panic which had set in during 1873, the Silver
21297	Purchase Act, and the re-issue of Greenbacks cut away some of the
21298	grounds of agitation. There was also a diversion of forces to the silver
21299	faction which had a substantial support in the silver mine owners of the
21300	West. At all events the Greenback vote fell to about 300,000 in the
21301	election of 1880. A still greater drop came four years later and the
21302	party gave up the ghost, its sponsors returning to their former
21303	allegiance or sulking in their tents.
21304	
21305	=The Rise of the Populist Party.=--Those leaders of the old parties who
21306	now looked for a happy future unvexed by new factions were doomed to
21307	disappointment. The funeral of the Greenback party was hardly over
21308	before there arose two other political specters in the agrarian
21309	sections: the National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union,
21310	particularly strong in the South and West; and the Farmers' Alliance,
21311	operating in the North. By 1890 the two orders claimed over three
21312	million members. As in the case of the Grangers many years before, the
21313	leaders among them found an easy way into politics. In 1892 they held a
21314	convention, nominated a candidate for President, and adopted the name of
21315	"People's Party," from which they were known as Populists. Their
21316	platform, in every line, breathed a spirit of radicalism. They declared
21317	that "the newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled; public opinion
21318	silenced; business prostrate; our homes covered with mortgages; and the
21319	land concentrating in the hands of capitalists.... The fruits of the
21320	toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a
21321	few." Having delivered this sweeping indictment, the Populists put
21322	forward their remedies: the free coinage of silver, a graduated income
21323	tax, postal savings banks, and government ownership of railways and
21324	telegraphs. At the same time they approved the initiative, referendum,
21325	and popular election of Senators, and condemned the use of federal
21326	troops in labor disputes. On this platform, the Populists polled over a
21327	million votes, captured twenty-two presidential electors, and sent a
21328	powerful delegation to Congress.
21329	
21330	=Industrial Distress Augments Unrest.=--The four years intervening
21331	between the campaign of 1892 and the next presidential election brought
21332	forth many events which aggravated the ill-feeling expressed in the
21333	portentous platform of Populism. Cleveland, a consistent enemy of free
21334	silver, gave his powerful support to the gold standard and insisted on
21335	the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act, thus alienating an increasing
21336	number of his own party. In 1893 a grave industrial crisis fell upon the
21337	land: banks and business houses went into bankruptcy with startling
21338	rapidity; factories were closed; idle men thronged the streets hunting
21339	for work; and the prices of wheat and corn dropped to a ruinous level.
21340	Labor disputes also filled the crowded record. A strike at the Pullman
21341	car works in Chicago spread to the railways. Disorders ensued. President
21342	Cleveland, against the protests of the governor of Illinois, John P.
21343	Altgeld, dispatched troops to the scene of action. The United States
21344	district court at Chicago issued an injunction forbidding the president
21345	of the Railway Union, Eugene V. Debs, or his assistants to interfere
21346	with the transmission of the mails or interstate commerce in any form.
21347	For refusing to obey the order, Debs was arrested and imprisoned. With
21348	federal troops in possession of the field, with their leader in jail,
21349	the strikers gave up the battle, defeated but not subdued. To cap the
21350	climax the Supreme Court of the United States, the following year (1895)
21351	declared null and void the income tax law just enacted by Congress, thus
21352	fanning the flames of Populist discontent all over the West and South.
21353	
21354	
21355	THE SOUND MONEY BATTLE OF 1896
21356	
21357	=Conservative Men Alarmed.=--Men of conservative thought and leaning in
21358	both parties were by this time thoroughly disturbed. They looked upon
21359	the rise of Populism and the growth of labor disputes as the signs of a
21360	revolutionary spirit, indeed nothing short of a menace to American
21361	institutions and ideals. The income tax law of 1894, exclaimed the
21362	distinguished New York advocate, Joseph H. Choate, in an impassioned
21363	speech before the Supreme Court, "is communistic in its purposes and
21364	tendencies and is defended here upon principles as communistic,
21365	socialistic--what shall I call them--populistic as ever have been
21366	addressed to any political assembly in the world." Mr. Justice Field in
21367	the name of the Court replied: "The present assault upon capital is but
21368	the beginning. It will be but the stepping stone to others larger and
21369	more sweeping till our political conditions will become a war of the
21370	poor against the rich." In declaring the income tax unconstitutional, he
21371	believed that he was but averting greater evils lurking under its guise.
21372	As for free silver, nearly all conservative men were united in calling
21373	it a measure of confiscation and repudiation; an effort of the debtors
21374	to pay their obligations with money worth fifty cents on the dollar; the
21375	climax of villainies openly defended; a challenge to law, order, and
21376	honor.
21377	
21378	=The Republicans Come Out for the Gold Standard.=--It was among the
21379	Republicans that this opinion was most widely shared and firmly held. It
21380	was they who picked up the gauge thrown down by the Populists, though a
21381	host of Democrats, like Cleveland and Hill of New York, also battled
21382	against the growing Populist defection in Democratic ranks. When the
21383	Republican national convention assembled in 1896, the die was soon
21384	cast; a declaration of opposition to free silver save by international
21385	agreement was carried by a vote of eight to one. The Republican party,
21386	to use the vigorous language of Mr. Lodge, arrayed itself against "not
21387	only that organized failure, the Democratic party, but all the wandering
21388	forces of political chaos and social disorder ... in these bitter times
21389	when the forces of disorder are loose and the wreckers with their false
21390	lights gather at the shore to lure the ship of state upon the rocks."
21391	Yet it is due to historic truth to state that McKinley, whom the
21392	Republicans nominated, had voted in Congress for the free coinage of
21393	silver, was widely known as a bimetallist, and was only with difficulty
21394	persuaded to accept the unequivocal indorsement of the gold standard
21395	which was pressed upon him by his counselors. Having accepted it,
21396	however, he proved to be a valiant champion, though his major interest
21397	was undoubtedly in the protective tariff. To him nothing was more
21398	reprehensible than attempts "to array class against class, 'the classes
21399	against the masses,' section against section, labor against capital,
21400	'the poor against the rich,' or interest against interest." Such was the
21401	language of his acceptance speech. The whole program of Populism he now
21402	viewed as a "sudden, dangerous, and revolutionary assault upon law and
21403	order."
21404	
21405	=The Democratic Convention at Chicago.=--Never, save at the great
21406	disruption on the eve of the Civil War, did a Democratic national
21407	convention display more feeling than at Chicago in 1896. From the
21408	opening prayer to the last motion before the house, every act, every
21409	speech, every scene, every resolution evoked passions and sowed
21410	dissensions. Departing from long party custom, it voted down in anger a
21411	proposal to praise the administration of the Democratic President,
21412	Cleveland. When the platform with its radical planks, including free
21413	silver, was reported, a veritable storm broke. Senator Hill, trembling
21414	with emotion, protested against the departure from old tests of
21415	Democratic allegiance; against principles that must drive out of the
21416	party men who had grown gray in its service; against revolutionary,
21417	unwise, and unprecedented steps in the history of the party. Senator
21418	Vilas of Wisconsin, in great fervor, avowed that there was no difference
21419	in principle between the free coinage of silver--"the confiscation of
21420	one-half of the credits of the nation for the benefit of debtors"--and
21421	communism itself--"a universal distribution of property." In the triumph
21422	of that cause he saw the beginning of "the overthrow of all law, all
21423	justice, all security and repose in the social order."
21424	
21425	[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._
21426	
21427	WILLIAM J. BRYAN IN 1898]
21428	
21429	=The Crown of Thorns Speech.=--The champions of free silver replied in
21430	strident tones. They accused the gold advocates of being the aggressors
21431	who had assailed the labor and the homes of the people. William Jennings
21432	Bryan, of Nebraska, voiced their sentiments in a memorable oration. He
21433	declared that their cause "was as holy as the cause of liberty--the
21434	cause of humanity." He exclaimed that the contest was between the idle
21435	holders of idle capital and the toiling millions. Then he named those
21436	for whom he spoke--the wage-earner, the country lawyer, the small
21437	merchant, the farmer, and the miner. "The man who is employed for wages
21438	is as much a business man as his employer. The attorney in a country
21439	town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great
21440	metropolis. The merchant at the cross roads store is as much a business
21441	man as the merchant of New York. The farmer ... is as much a business
21442	man as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price
21443	of grain. The miners who go a thousand feet into the earth or climb two
21444	thousand feet upon the cliffs ... are as much business men as the few
21445	financial magnates who in a back room corner the money of the world....
21446	It is for these that we speak. We do not come as aggressors. Ours is not
21447	a war of conquest. We are fighting in defense of our homes, our
21448	families, and our posterity. We have petitioned and our petitions have
21449	been scorned. We have entreated and our entreaties have been
21450	disregarded. We have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came.
21451	We beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. We defy
21452	them.... We shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to
21453	them, 'You shall not press upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.
21454	You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.'"
21455	
21456	=Bryan Nominated.=--In all the history of national conventions never had
21457	an orator so completely swayed a multitude; not even Yancey in his
21458	memorable plea in the Charleston convention of 1860 when, with grave and
21459	moving eloquence, he espoused the Southern cause against the impending
21460	fates. The delegates, after cheering Mr. Bryan until they could cheer no
21461	more, tore the standards from the floor and gathered around the Nebraska
21462	delegation to renew the deafening applause. The platform as reported was
21463	carried by a vote of two to one and the young orator from the West,
21464	hailed as America's Tiberius Gracchus, was nominated as the Democratic
21465	candidate for President. The South and West had triumphed over the East.
21466	The division was sectional, admittedly sectional--the old combination of
21467	power which Calhoun had so anxiously labored to build up a century
21468	earlier. The Gold Democrats were repudiated in terms which were clear to
21469	all. A few, unable to endure the thought of voting the Republican
21470	ticket, held a convention at Indianapolis where, with the sanction of
21471	Cleveland, they nominated candidates of their own and endorsed the gold
21472	standard in a forlorn hope.
21473	
21474	=The Democratic Platform.=--It was to the call from Chicago that the
21475	Democrats gave heed and the Republicans made answer. The platform on
21476	which Mr. Bryan stood, unlike most party manifestoes, was explicit in
21477	its language and its appeal. It denounced the practice of allowing
21478	national banks to issue notes intended to circulate as money on the
21479	ground that it was "in derogation of the Constitution," recalling
21480	Jackson's famous attack on the Bank in 1832. It declared that tariff
21481	duties should be laid "for the purpose of revenue"--Calhoun's doctrine.
21482	In demanding the free coinage of silver, it recurred to the practice
21483	abandoned in 1873. The income tax came next on the program. The platform
21484	alleged that the law of 1894, passed by a Democratic Congress, was "in
21485	strict pursuance of the uniform decisions of the Supreme Court for
21486	nearly a hundred years," and then hinted that the decision annulling the
21487	law might be reversed by the same body "as it may hereafter be
21488	constituted."
21489	
21490	The appeal to labor voiced by Mr. Bryan in his "crown of thorns" speech
21491	was reinforced in the platform. "As labor creates the wealth of the
21492	country," ran one plank, "we demand the passage of such laws as may be
21493	necessary to protect it in all its rights." Referring to the recent
21494	Pullman strike, the passions of which had not yet died away, the
21495	platform denounced "arbitrary interference by federal authorities in
21496	local affairs as a violation of the Constitution of the United States
21497	and a crime against free institutions." A special objection was lodged
21498	against "government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of
21499	oppression by which federal judges, in contempt of the laws of states
21500	and rights of citizens, become at once legislators, judges, and
21501	executioners." The remedy advanced was a federal law assuring trial by
21502	jury in all cases of contempt in labor disputes. Having made this
21503	declaration of faith, the Democrats, with Mr. Bryan at the head, raised
21504	their standard of battle.
21505	
21506	=The Heated Campaign.=--The campaign which ensued outrivaled in the
21507	range of its educational activities and the bitterness of its tone all
21508	other political conflicts in American history, not excepting the fateful
21509	struggle of 1860. Immense sums of money were contributed to the funds of
21510	both parties. Railway, banking, and other corporations gave generously
21511	to the Republicans; the silver miners, less lavishly but with the same
21512	anxiety, supported the Democrats. The country was flooded with
21513	pamphlets, posters, and handbills. Every public forum, from the great
21514	auditoriums of the cities to the "red schoolhouses" on the countryside,
21515	was occupied by the opposing forces.
21516	
21517	Mr. Bryan took the stump himself, visiting all parts of the country in
21518	special trains and addressing literally millions of people in the open
21519	air. Mr. McKinley chose the older and more formal plan. He received
21520	delegations at his home in Canton and discussed the issues of the
21521	campaign from his front porch, leaving to an army of well-organized
21522	orators the task of reaching the people in their home towns. Parades,
21523	processions, and monster demonstrations filled the land with politics.
21524	Whole states were polled in advance by the Republicans and the doubtful
21525	voters personally visited by men equipped with arguments and literature.
21526	Manufacturers, frightened at the possibility of disordered public
21527	credit, announced that they would close their doors if the Democrats won
21528	the election. Men were dismissed from public and private places on
21529	account of their political views, one eminent college president being
21530	forced out for advocating free silver. The language employed by
21531	impassioned and embittered speakers on both sides roused the public to a
21532	state of frenzy, once more showing the lengths to which men could go in
21533	personal and political abuse.
21534	
21535	=The Republican Victory.=--The verdict of the nation was decisive.
21536	McKinley received 271 of the 447 electoral votes, and 7,111,000 popular
21537	votes as against Bryan's 6,509,000. The congressional elections were
21538	equally positive although, on account of the composition of the Senate,
21539	the "hold-over" Democrats and Populists still enjoyed a power out of
21540	proportion to their strength as measured at the polls. Even as it was,
21541	the Republicans got full control of both houses--a dominion of the
21542	entire government which they were to hold for fourteen years--until the
21543	second half of Mr. Taft's administration, when they lost possession of
21544	the House of Representatives. The yoke of indecision was broken. The
21545	party of sound finance and protective tariffs set out upon its lease of
21546	power with untroubled assurance.
21547	
21548	
21549	REPUBLICAN MEASURES AND RESULTS
21550	
21551	=The Gold Standard and the Tariff.=--Yet strange as it may seem, the
21552	Republicans did not at once enact legislation making the gold dollar the
21553	standard for the national currency. Not until 1900 did they take that
21554	positive step. In his first inaugural President McKinley, as if still
21555	uncertain in his own mind or fearing a revival of the contest just
21556	closed, placed the tariff, not the money question, in the forefront.
21557	"The people have decided," he said, "that such legislation should be had
21558	as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and
21559	development of our country." Protection for American industries,
21560	therefore, he urged, is the task before Congress. "With adequate revenue
21561	secured, but not until then, we can enter upon changes in our fiscal
21562	laws." As the Republicans had only forty-six of the ninety Senators, and
21563	at least four of them were known advocates of free silver, the
21564	discretion exercised by the President in selecting the tariff for
21565	congressional debate was the better part of valor.
21566	
21567	Congress gave heed to the warning. Under the direction of Nelson P.
21568	Dingley, whose name was given to the bill, a tariff measure levying the
21569	highest rates yet laid in the history of American imposts was prepared
21570	and driven through the House of Representatives. The opposition
21571	encountered in the Senate, especially from the West, was overcome by
21572	concessions in favor of that section; but the duties on sugar, tin,
21573	steel, lumber, hemp, and in fact all of the essential commodities
21574	handled by combinations and trusts, were materially raised.
21575	
21576	[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._
21577	
21578	PRESIDENT MCKINLEY AND HIS CABINET]
21579	
21580	=Growth of Combinations.=--The years that followed the enactment of the
21581	Dingley law were, whatever the cause, the most prosperous the country
21582	had witnessed for many a decade. Industries of every kind were soon
21583	running full blast; labor was employed; commerce spread more swiftly
21584	than ever to the markets of the world. Coincident with this progress was
21585	the organization of the greatest combinations and trusts the world had
21586	yet seen. In 1899 the smelters formed a trust with a capital of
21587	$65,000,000; in the same year the Standard Oil Company with a capital of
21588	over one hundred millions took the place of the old trust; and the
21589	Copper Trust was incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, its par
21590	value capital being fixed shortly afterward at $175,000,000. A year
21591	later the National Sugar Refining Company, of New Jersey, started with a
21592	capital of $90,000,000, adopting the policy of issuing to the
21593	stockholders no public statement of its earnings or financial condition.
21594	Before another twelvemonth had elapsed all previous corporate financing
21595	was reduced to small proportions by the flotation of the United States
21596	Steel Corporation with a capital of more than a billion dollars, an
21597	enterprise set in motion by the famous Morgan banking house of New York.
21598	
21599	In nearly all these gigantic undertakings, the same great leaders in
21600	finance were more or less intimately associated. To use the language of
21601	an eminent authority: "They are all allied and intertwined by their
21602	various mutual interests. For instance, the Pennsylvania Railroad
21603	interests are on the one hand allied with the Vanderbilts and on the
21604	other with the Rockefellers. The Vanderbilts are closely allied with the
21605	Morgan group.... Viewed as a whole we find the dominating influences in
21606	the trusts to be made up of a network of large and small capitalists,
21607	many allied to one another by ties of more or less importance, but all
21608	being appendages to or parts of the greater groups which are themselves
21609	dependent on and allied with the two mammoth or Rockefeller and Morgan
21610	groups. These two mammoth groups jointly ... constitute the heart of the
21611	business and commercial life of the nation." Such was the picture of
21612	triumphant business enterprise drawn by a financier within a few years
21613	after the memorable campaign of 1896.
21614	
21615	America had become one of the first workshops of the world. It was, by
21616	virtue of the closely knit organization of its business and finance, one
21617	of the most powerful and energetic leaders in the struggle of the giants
21618	for the business of the earth. The capital of the Steel Corporation
21619	alone was more than ten times the total national debt which the apostles
21620	of calamity in the days of Washington and Hamilton declared the nation
21621	could never pay. American industry, filling domestic markets to
21622	overflowing, was ready for new worlds to conquer.

21730	CHAPTER XX
21731	
21732	AMERICA A WORLD POWER (1865-1900)
21733	
21734	
21735	It has now become a fashion, sanctioned by wide usage and by eminent
21736	historians, to speak of America, triumphant over Spain and possessed of
21737	new colonies, as entering the twentieth century in the role of "a world
21738	power," for the first time. Perhaps at this late day, it is useless to
21739	protest against the currency of the idea. Nevertheless, the truth is
21740	that from the fateful moment in March, 1775, when Edmund Burke unfolded
21741	to his colleagues in the British Parliament the resources of an
21742	invincible America, down to the settlement at Versailles in 1919 closing
21743	the drama of the World War, this nation has been a world power,
21744	influencing by its example, by its institutions, by its wealth, trade,
21745	and arms the course of international affairs. And it should be said also
21746	that neither in the field of commercial enterprise nor in that of
21747	diplomacy has it been wanting in spirit or ingenuity.
21748	
21749	When John Hay, Secretary of State, heard that an American citizen,
21750	Perdicaris, had been seized by Raisuli, a Moroccan bandit, in 1904, he
21751	wired his brusque message: "We want Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead."
21752	This was but an echo of Commodore Decatur's equally characteristic
21753	answer, "Not a minute," given nearly a hundred years before to the
21754	pirates of Algiers begging for time to consider whether they would cease
21755	preying upon American merchantmen. Was it not as early as 1844 that the
21756	American commissioner, Caleb Cushing, taking advantage of the British
21757	Opium War on China, negotiated with the Celestial Empire a successful
21758	commercial treaty? Did he not then exultantly exclaim: "The laws of the
21759	Union follow its citizens and its banner protects them even within the
21760	domain of the Chinese Empire"? Was it not almost half a century before
21761	the battle of Manila Bay in 1898, that Commodore Perry with an adequate
21762	naval force "gently coerced Japan into friendship with us," leading all
21763	the nations of the earth in the opening of that empire to the trade of
21764	the Occident? Nor is it inappropriate in this connection to recall the
21765	fact that the Monroe Doctrine celebrates in 1923 its hundredth
21766	anniversary.
21767	
21768	
21769	AMERICAN FOREIGN RELATIONS (1865-98)
21770	
21771	=French Intrigues in Mexico Blocked.=--Between the war for the union and
21772	the war with Spain, the Department of State had many an occasion to
21773	present the rights of America among the powers of the world. Only a
21774	little while after the civil conflict came to a close, it was called
21775	upon to deal with a dangerous situation created in Mexico by the
21776	ambitions of Napoleon III. During the administration of Buchanan, Mexico
21777	had fallen into disorder through the strife of the Liberal and the
21778	Clerical parties; the President asked for authority to use American
21779	troops to bring to a peaceful haven "a wreck upon the ocean, drifting
21780	about as she is impelled by different factions." Our own domestic crisis
21781	then intervened.
21782	
21783	Observing the United States heavily involved in its own problems, the
21784	great powers, England, France, and Spain, decided in the autumn of 1861
21785	to take a hand themselves in restoring order in Mexico. They entered
21786	into an agreement to enforce the claims of their citizens against Mexico
21787	and to protect their subjects residing in that republic. They invited
21788	the United States to join them, and, on meeting a polite refusal, they
21789	prepared for a combined military and naval demonstration on their own
21790	account. In the midst of this action England and Spain, discovering the
21791	sinister purposes of Napoleon, withdrew their troops and left the field
21792	to him.
21793	
21794	The French Emperor, it was well known, looked with jealousy upon the
21795	growth of the United States and dreamed of establishing in the Western
21796	hemisphere an imperial power to offset the American republic.
21797	Intervention to collect debts was only a cloak for his deeper designs.
21798	Throwing off that guise in due time, he made the Archduke Maximilian, a
21799	brother of the ruler of Austria, emperor in Mexico, and surrounded his
21800	throne by French soldiers, in spite of all protests.
21801	
21802	This insolent attack upon the Mexican republic, deeply resented in the
21803	United States, was allowed to drift in its course until 1865. At that
21804	juncture General Sheridan was dispatched to the Mexican border with a
21805	large armed force; General Grant urged the use of the American army to
21806	expel the French from this continent. The Secretary of State, Seward,
21807	counseled negotiation first, and, applying the Monroe Doctrine, was able
21808	to prevail upon Napoleon III to withdraw his troops. Without the support
21809	of French arms, the sham empire in Mexico collapsed like a house of
21810	cards and the unhappy Maximilian, the victim of French ambition and
21811	intrigue, met his death at the hands of a Mexican firing squad.
21812	
21813	=Alaska Purchased.=--The Mexican affair had not been brought to a close
21814	before the Department of State was busy with negotiations which resulted
21815	in the purchase of Alaska from Russia. The treaty of cession, signed on
21816	March 30, 1867, added to the United States a domain of nearly six
21817	hundred thousand square miles, a territory larger than Texas and nearly
21818	three-fourths the size of the Louisiana purchase. Though it was a
21819	distant colony separated from our continental domain by a thousand miles
21820	of water, no question of "imperialism" or "colonization foreign to
21821	American doctrines" seems to have been raised at the time. The treaty
21822	was ratified promptly by the Senate. The purchase price, $7,200,000, was
21823	voted by the House of Representatives after the display of some
21824	resentment against a system that compelled it to appropriate money to
21825	fulfill an obligation which it had no part in making. Seward, who
21826	formulated the treaty, rejoiced, as he afterwards said, that he had kept
21827	Alaska out of the hands of England.
21828	
21829	=American Interest in the Caribbean.=--Having achieved this diplomatic
21830	triumph, Seward turned to the increase of American power in another
21831	direction. He negotiated, with Denmark, a treaty providing for the
21832	purchase of the islands of St. John and St. Thomas in the West Indies,
21833	strategic points in the Caribbean for sea power. This project, long
21834	afterward brought to fruition by other men, was defeated on this
21835	occasion by the refusal of the Senate to ratify the treaty. Evidently it
21836	was not yet prepared to exercise colonial dominion over other races.
21837	
21838	Undaunted by the misadventure in Caribbean policies, President Grant
21839	warmly advocated the acquisition of Santo Domingo. This little republic
21840	had long been in a state of general disorder. In 1869 a treaty of
21841	annexation was concluded with its president. The document Grant
21842	transmitted to the Senate with his cordial approval, only to have it
21843	rejected. Not at all changed in his opinion by the outcome of his
21844	effort, he continued to urge the subject of annexation. Even in his last
21845	message to Congress he referred to it, saying that time had only proved
21846	the wisdom of his early course. The addition of Santo Domingo to the
21847	American sphere of protection was the work of a later generation. The
21848	State Department, temporarily checked, had to bide its time.
21849	
21850	=The _Alabama_ Claims Arbitrated.=--Indeed, it had in hand a far more
21851	serious matter, a vexing issue that grew out of Civil War diplomacy. The
21852	British government, as already pointed out in other connections, had
21853	permitted Confederate cruisers, including the famous _Alabama_, built in
21854	British ports, to escape and prey upon the commerce of the Northern
21855	states. This action, denounced at the time by our government as a grave
21856	breach of neutrality as well as a grievous injury to American citizens,
21857	led first to remonstrances and finally to repeated claims for damages
21858	done to American ships and goods. For a long time Great Britain was
21859	firm. Her foreign secretary denied all obligations in the premises,
21860	adding somewhat curtly that "he wished to say once for all that Her
21861	Majesty's government disclaimed any responsibility for the losses and
21862	hoped that they had made their position perfectly clear." Still
21863	President Grant was not persuaded that the door of diplomacy, though
21864	closed, was barred. Hamilton Fish, his Secretary of State, renewed the
21865	demand. Finally he secured from the British government in 1871 the
21866	treaty of Washington providing for the arbitration not merely of the
21867	_Alabama_ and other claims but also all points of serious controversy
21868	between the two countries.
21869	
21870	The tribunal of arbitration thus authorized sat at Geneva in
21871	Switzerland, and after a long and careful review of the arguments on
21872	both sides awarded to the United States the lump sum of $15,500,000 to
21873	be distributed among the American claimants. The damages thus allowed
21874	were large, unquestionably larger than strict justice required and it is
21875	not surprising that the decision excited much adverse comment in
21876	England. Nevertheless, the prompt payment by the British government
21877	swept away at once a great cloud of ill-feeling in America. Moreover,
21878	the spectacle of two powerful nations choosing the way of peaceful
21879	arbitration to settle an angry dispute seemed a happy, if illusory, omen
21880	of a modern method for avoiding the arbitrament of war.
21881	
21882	=Samoa.=--If the Senate had its doubts at first about the wisdom of
21883	acquiring strategic points for naval power in distant seas, the same
21884	could not be said of the State Department or naval officers. In 1872
21885	Commander Meade, of the United States navy, alive to the importance of
21886	coaling stations even in mid-ocean, made a commercial agreement with the
21887	chief of Tutuila, one of the Samoan Islands, far below the equator, in
21888	the southern Pacific, nearer to Australia than to California. This
21889	agreement, providing among other things for our use of the harbor of
21890	Pago Pago as a naval base, was six years later changed into a formal
21891	treaty ratified by the Senate.
21892	
21893	Such enterprise could not escape the vigilant eyes of England and
21894	Germany, both mindful of the course of the sea power in history. The
21895	German emperor, seizing as a pretext a quarrel between his consul in the
21896	islands and a native king, laid claim to an interest in the Samoan
21897	group. England, aware of the dangers arising from German outposts in the
21898	southern seas so near to Australia, was not content to stand aside. So
21899	it happened that all three countries sent battleships to the Samoan
21900	waters, threatening a crisis that was fortunately averted by friendly
21901	settlement. If, as is alleged, Germany entertained a notion of
21902	challenging American sea power then and there, the presence of British
21903	ships must have dispelled that dream.
21904	
21905	The result of the affair was a tripartite agreement by which the three
21906	powers in 1889 undertook a protectorate over the islands. But joint
21907	control proved unsatisfactory. There was constant friction between the
21908	Germans and the English. The spheres of authority being vague and open
21909	to dispute, the plan had to be abandoned at the end of ten years.
21910	England withdrew altogether, leaving to Germany all the islands except
21911	Tutuila, which was ceded outright to the United States. Thus one of the
21912	finest harbors in the Pacific, to the intense delight of the American
21913	navy, passed permanently under American dominion. Another triumph in
21914	diplomacy was set down to the credit of the State Department.
21915	
21916	=Cleveland and the Venezuela Affair.=--In the relations with South
21917	America, as well as in those with the distant Pacific, the diplomacy of
21918	the government at Washington was put to the test. For some time it had
21919	been watching a dispute between England and Venezuela over the western
21920	boundary of British Guiana and, on an appeal from Venezuela, it had
21921	taken a lively interest in the contest. In 1895 President Cleveland saw
21922	that Great Britain would yield none of her claims. After hearing the
21923	arguments of Venezuela, his Secretary of State, Richard T. Olney, in a
21924	note none too conciliatory, asked the British government whether it was
21925	willing to arbitrate the points in controversy. This inquiry he
21926	accompanied by a warning to the effect that the United States could not
21927	permit any European power to contest its mastery in this hemisphere.
21928	"The United States," said the Secretary, "is practically sovereign on
21929	this continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it
21930	confines its interposition.... Its infinite resources, combined with its
21931	isolated position, render it master of the situation and practically
21932	invulnerable against any or all other powers."
21933	
21934	The reply evoked from the British government by this strong statement
21935	was firm and clear. The Monroe Doctrine, it said, even if not so widely
21936	stretched by interpretation, was not binding in international law; the
21937	dispute with Venezuela was a matter of interest merely to the parties
21938	involved; and arbitration of the question was impossible. This response
21939	called forth President Cleveland's startling message of 1895. He asked
21940	Congress to create a commission authorized to ascertain by researches
21941	the true boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana. He added that it
21942	would be the duty of this country "to resist by every means in its
21943	power, as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests, the
21944	appropriation by Great Britain of any lands or the exercise of
21945	governmental jurisdiction over any territory which, after investigation,
21946	we have determined of right belongs to Venezuela." The serious character
21947	of this statement he thoroughly understood. He declared that he was
21948	conscious of his responsibilities, intimating that war, much as it was
21949	to be deplored, was not comparable to "a supine submission to wrong and
21950	injustice and the consequent loss of national self-respect and honor."
21951	
21952	[Illustration: GROVER CLEVELAND]
21953	
21954	The note of defiance which ran through this message, greeted by shrill
21955	cries of enthusiasm in many circles, was viewed in other quarters as a
21956	portent of war. Responsible newspapers in both countries spoke of an
21957	armed settlement of the dispute as inevitable. Congress created the
21958	commission and appropriated money for the investigation; a body of
21959	learned men was appointed to determine the merits of the conflicting
21960	boundary claims. The British government, deaf to the clamor of the
21961	bellicose section of the London press, deplored the incident,
21962	courteously replied in the affirmative to a request for assistance in
21963	the search for evidence, and finally agreed to the proposition that the
21964	issue be submitted to arbitration. The outcome of this somewhat perilous
21965	dispute contributed not a little to Cleveland's reputation as "a
21966	sterling representative of the true American spirit." This was not
21967	diminished when the tribunal of arbitration found that Great Britain was
21968	on the whole right in her territorial claims against Venezuela.
21969	
21970	=The Annexation of Hawaii.=--While engaged in the dangerous Venezuela
21971	controversy, President Cleveland was compelled by a strange turn in
21972	events to consider the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands in the
21973	mid-Pacific. For more than half a century American missionaries had been
21974	active in converting the natives to the Christian faith and enterprising
21975	American business men had been developing the fertile sugar plantations.
21976	Both the Department of State and the Navy Department were fully
21977	conscious of the strategic relation of the islands to the growth of sea
21978	power and watched with anxiety any developments likely to bring them
21979	under some other Dominion.
21980	
21981	The country at large was indifferent, however, until 1893, when a
21982	revolution, headed by Americans, broke out, ending in the overthrow of
21983	the native government, the abolition of the primitive monarchy, and the
21984	retirement of Queen Liliuokalani to private life. This crisis, a
21985	repetition of the Texas affair in a small theater, was immediately
21986	followed by a demand from the new Hawaiian government for annexation to
21987	the United States. President Harrison looked with favor on the proposal,
21988	negotiated the treaty of annexation, and laid it before the Senate for
21989	approval. There it still rested when his term of office was brought to a
21990	close.
21991	
21992	Harrison's successor, Cleveland, it was well known, had doubts about the
21993	propriety of American action in Hawaii. For the purpose of making an
21994	inquiry into the matter, he sent a special commissioner to the islands.
21995	On the basis of the report of his agent, Cleveland came to the
21996	conclusion that "the revolution in the island kingdom had been
21997	accomplished by the improper use of the armed forces of the United
21998	States and that the wrong should be righted by a restoration of the
21999	queen to her throne." Such being his matured conviction, though the
22000	facts upon which he rested it were warmly controverted, he could do
22001	nothing but withdraw the treaty from the Senate and close the incident.
22002	
22003	To the Republicans this sharp and cavalier disposal of their plans,
22004	carried out in a way that impugned the motives of a Republican
22005	President, was nothing less than "a betrayal of American interests." In
22006	their platform of 1896 they made clear their position: "Our foreign
22007	policy should be at all times firm, vigorous, and dignified and all our
22008	interests in the Western hemisphere carefully watched and guarded. The
22009	Hawaiian Islands should be controlled by the United States and no
22010	foreign power should be permitted to interfere with them." There was no
22011	mistaking this view of the issue. As the vote in the election gave
22012	popular sanction to Republican policies, Congress by a joint resolution,
22013	passed on July 6, 1898, annexed the islands to the United States and
22014	later conferred upon them the ordinary territorial form of government.
22015	
22016	
22017	CUBA AND THE SPANISH WAR
22018	
22019	=Early American Relations with Cuba.=--The year that brought Hawaii
22020	finally under the American flag likewise drew to a conclusion another
22021	long controversy over a similar outpost in the Atlantic, one of the last
22022	remnants of the once glorious Spanish empire--the island of Cuba.
22023	
22024	For a century the Department of State had kept an anxious eye upon this
22025	base of power, knowing full well that both France and England, already
22026	well established in the West Indies, had their attention also fixed upon
22027	Cuba. In the administration of President Fillmore they had united in
22028	proposing to the United States a tripartite treaty guaranteeing Spain in
22029	her none too certain ownership. This proposal, squarely rejected,
22030	furnished the occasion for a statement of American policy which stood
22031	the test of all the years that followed; namely, that the affair was one
22032	between Spain and the United States alone.
22033	
22034	In that long contest in the United States for the balance of power
22035	between the North and South, leaders in the latter section often thought
22036	of bringing Cuba into the union to offset the free states. An
22037	opportunity to announce their purposes publicly was afforded in 1854 by
22038	a controversy over the seizure of an American ship by Cuban authorities.
22039	On that occasion three American ministers abroad, stationed at Madrid,
22040	Paris, and London respectively, held a conference and issued the
22041	celebrated "Ostend Manifesto." They united in declaring that Cuba, by
22042	her geographical position, formed a part of the United States, that
22043	possession by a foreign power was inimical to American interests, and
22044	that an effort should be made to purchase the island from Spain. In case
22045	the owner refused to sell, they concluded, with a menacing flourish, "by
22046	every law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from
22047	Spain if we possess the power." This startling proclamation to the world
22048	was promptly disowned by the United States government.
22049	
22050	[Illustration: _=An old cartoon.=_
22051	
22052	A SIGHT TOO BAD
22053	
22054	_Struggling Cuba._ "You must be awfully near-sighted, Mr. President, not
22055	to recognize me." _U.S.G._ "No, I am far-sighted: for I can recognize
22056	France."]
22057	
22058	=Revolutions in Cuba.=--For nearly twenty years afterwards the Cuban
22059	question rested. Then it was revived in another form during President
22060	Grant's administrations, when the natives became engaged in a
22061	destructive revolt against Spanish officials. For ten years--1868-78--a
22062	guerrilla warfare raged in the island. American citizens, by virtue of
22063	their ancient traditions of democracy, naturally sympathized with a war
22064	for independence and self-government. Expeditions to help the insurgents
22065	were fitted out secretly in American ports. Arms and supplies were
22066	smuggled into Cuba. American soldiers of fortune joined their ranks. The
22067	enforcement of neutrality against the friends of Cuban independence, no
22068	pleasing task for a sympathetic President, the protection of American
22069	lives and property in the revolutionary area, and similar matters kept
22070	our government busy with Cuba for a whole decade.
22071	
22072	A brief lull in Cuban disorders was followed in 1895 by a renewal of the
22073	revolutionary movement. The contest between the rebels and the Spanish
22074	troops, marked by extreme cruelty and a total disregard for life and
22075	property, exceeded all bounds of decency, and once more raised the old
22076	questions that had tormented Grant's administration. Gomez, the leader
22077	of the revolt, intent upon provoking American interference, laid waste
22078	the land with fire and sword. By a proclamation of November 6, 1895, he
22079	ordered the destruction of sugar plantations and railway connections and
22080	the closure of all sugar factories. The work of ruin was completed by
22081	the ruthless Spanish general, Weyler, who concentrated the inhabitants
22082	from rural regions into military camps, where they died by the hundreds
22083	of disease and starvation. Stories of the atrocities, bad enough in
22084	simple form, became lurid when transmuted into American news and deeply
22085	moved the sympathies of the American people. Sermons were preached about
22086	Spanish misdeeds; orators demanded that the Cubans be sustained "in
22087	their heroic struggle for independence"; newspapers, scouting the
22088	ordinary forms of diplomatic negotiation, spurned mediation and demanded
22089	intervention and war if necessary.

22093	CUBAN REVOLUTIONISTS]
22094	
22095	=President Cleveland's Policy.=--Cleveland chose the way of peace. He
22096	ordered the observance of the rule of neutrality. He declined to act on
22097	a resolution of Congress in favor of giving to the Cubans the rights of
22098	belligerents. Anxious to bring order to the distracted island, he
22099	tendered to Spain the good offices of the United States as mediator in
22100	the contest--a tender rejected by the Spanish government with the broad
22101	hint that President Cleveland might be more vigorous in putting a stop
22102	to the unlawful aid in money, arms, and supplies, afforded to the
22103	insurgents by American sympathizers. Thereupon the President returned to
22104	the course he had marked out for himself, leaving "the public nuisance"
22105	to his successor, President McKinley.
22106	
22107	=Republican Policies.=--The Republicans in 1897 found themselves in a
22108	position to employ that "firm, vigorous, and dignified" foreign policy
22109	which they had approved in their platform. They had declared: "The
22110	government of Spain having lost control of Cuba and being unable to
22111	
22112	protect the property or lives of resident American citizens or to comply
22113	with its treaty obligations, we believe that the government of the
22114	United States should actively use its influence and good offices to
22115	restore peace and give independence to the island." The American
22116	property in Cuba to which the Republicans referred in their platform
22117	amounted by this time to more than fifty million dollars; the commerce
22118	with the island reached more than one hundred millions annually; and the
22119	claims of American citizens against Spain for property destroyed totaled
22120	sixteen millions. To the pleas of humanity which made such an effective
22121	appeal to the hearts of the American people, there were thus added
22122	practical considerations of great weight.
22123	
22124	=President McKinley Negotiates.=--In the face of the swelling tide of
22125	popular opinion in favor of quick, drastic, and positive action,
22126	McKinley chose first the way of diplomacy. A short time after his
22127	inauguration he lodged with the Spanish government a dignified protest
22128	against its policies in Cuba, thus opening a game of thrust and parry
22129	with the suave ministers at Madrid. The results of the exchange of
22130	notes were the recall of the obnoxious General Weyler, the appointment
22131	of a governor-general less bloodthirsty in his methods, a change in the
22132	policy of concentrating civilians in military camps, and finally a
22133	promise of "home rule" for Cuba. There is no doubt that the Spanish
22134	government was eager to avoid a war that could have but one outcome. The
22135	American minister at Madrid, General Woodford, was convinced that firm
22136	and patient pressure would have resulted in the final surrender of Cuba
22137	by the Spanish government.
22138	
22139	=The De Lome and the _Maine_ Incidents.=--Such a policy was defeated by
22140	events. In February, 1898, a private letter written by Senor de Lome,
22141	the Spanish ambassador at Washington, expressing contempt for the
22142	President of the United States, was filched from the mails and passed
22143	into the hands of a journalist, William R. Hearst, who published it to
22144	the world. In the excited state of American opinion, few gave heed to
22145	the grave breach of diplomatic courtesy committed by breaking open
22146	private correspondence. The Spanish government was compelled to recall
22147	De Lome, thus officially condemning his conduct.
22148	
22149	At this point a far more serious crisis put the pacific relations of the
22150	two negotiating countries in dire peril. On February 15, the battleship
22151	_Maine_, riding in the harbor of Havana, was blown up and sunk, carrying
22152	to death two officers and two hundred and fifty-eight members of the
22153	crew. This tragedy, ascribed by the American public to the malevolence
22154	of Spanish officials, profoundly stirred an already furious nation.
22155	When, on March 21, a commission of inquiry reported that the ill-fated
22156	ship had been blown up by a submarine mine which had in turn set off
22157	some of the ship's magazines, the worst suspicions seemed confirmed. If
22158	any one was inclined to be indifferent to the Cuban war for
22159	independence, he was now met by the vehement cry: "Remember the
22160	_Maine_!"
22161	
22162	=Spanish Concessions.=--Still the State Department, under McKinley's
22163	steady hand, pursued the path of negotiation, Spain proving more pliable
22164	and more ready with promises of reform in the island. Early in April,
22165	however, there came a decided change in the tenor of American diplomacy.
22166	On the 4th, McKinley, evidently convinced that promises did not mean
22167	performances, instructed our minister at Madrid to warn the Spanish
22168	government that as no effective armistice had been offered to the
22169	Cubans, he would lay the whole matter before Congress. This decision,
22170	every one knew, from the temper of Congress, meant war--a prospect which
22171	excited all the European powers. The Pope took an active interest in the
22172	crisis. France and Germany, foreseeing from long experience in world
22173	politics an increase of American power and prestige through war, sought
22174	to prevent it. Spain, hopeless and conscious of her weakness, at last
22175	dispatched to the President a note promising to suspend hostilities, to
22176	call a Cuban parliament, and to grant all the autonomy that could be
22177	reasonably asked.
22178	
22179	=President McKinley Calls for War.=--For reasons of his own--reasons
22180	which have never yet been fully explained--McKinley ignored the final
22181	program of concessions presented by Spain. At the very moment when his
22182	patient negotiations seemed to bear full fruit, he veered sharply from
22183	his course and launched the country into the war by sending to Congress
22184	his militant message of April 11, 1898. Without making public the last
22185	note he had received from Spain, he declared that he was brought to the
22186	end of his effort and the cause was in the hands of Congress. Humanity,
22187	the protection of American citizens and property, the injuries to
22188	American commerce and business, the inability of Spain to bring about
22189	permanent peace in the island--these were the grounds for action that
22190	induced him to ask for authority to employ military and naval forces in
22191	establishing a stable government in Cuba. They were sufficient for a
22192	public already straining at the leash.
22193	
22194	=The Resolution of Congress.=--There was no doubt of the outcome when
22195	the issue was withdrawn from diplomacy and placed in charge of Congress.
22196	Resolutions were soon introduced into the House of Representatives
22197	authorizing the President to employ armed force in securing peace and
22198	order in the island and "establishing by the free action of the people
22199	thereof a stable and independent government of their own." To the form
22200	and spirit of this proposal the Democrats and Populists took exception.
22201	In the Senate, where they were stronger, their position had to be
22202	reckoned with by the narrow Republican majority. As the resolution
22203	finally read, the independence of Cuba was recognized; Spain was called
22204	upon to relinquish her authority and withdraw from the island; and the
22205	President was empowered to use force to the extent necessary to carry
22206	the resolutions into effect. Furthermore the United States disclaimed
22207	"any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or
22208	control over said island except for the pacification thereof." Final
22209	action was taken by Congress on April 19, 1898, and approved by the
22210	President on the following day.
22211	
22212	=War and Victory.=--Startling events then followed in swift succession.
22213	The navy, as a result in no small measure of the alertness of Theodore
22214	Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Department, was ready for the
22215	trial by battle. On May 1, Commodore Dewey at Manila Bay shattered the
22216	Spanish fleet, marking the doom of Spanish dominion in the Philippines.
22217	On July 3, the Spanish fleet under Admiral Cervera, in attempting to
22218	escape from Havana, was utterly destroyed by American forces under
22219	Commodore Schley. On July 17, Santiago, invested by American troops
22220	under General Shafter and shelled by the American ships, gave up the
22221	struggle. On July 25 General Miles landed in Porto Rico. On August 13,
22222	General Merritt and Admiral Dewey carried Manila by storm. The war was
22223	over.
22224	
22225	=The Peace Protocol.=--Spain had already taken cognizance of stern
22226	facts. As early as July 26, 1898, acting through the French ambassador,
22227	M. Cambon, the Madrid government approached President McKinley for a
22228	statement of the terms on which hostilities could be brought to a close.
22229	After some skirmishing Spain yielded reluctantly to the ultimatum. On
22230	August 12, the preliminary peace protocol was signed, stipulating that
22231	Cuba should be free, Porto Rico ceded to the United States, and Manila
22232	occupied by American troops pending the formal treaty of peace. On
22233	October 1, the commissioners of the two countries met at Paris to bring
22234	about the final settlement.
22235	
22236	=Peace Negotiations.=--When the day for the first session of the
22237	conference arrived, the government at Washington apparently had not made
22238	up its mind on the final disposition of the Philippines. Perhaps, before
22239	the battle of Manila Bay, not ten thousand people in the United States
22240	knew or cared where the Philippines were. Certainly there was in the
22241	autumn of 1898 no decided opinion as to what should be done with the
22242	fruits of Dewey's victory. President McKinley doubtless voiced the
22243	sentiment of the people when he stated to the peace commissioners on the
22244	eve of their departure that there had originally been no thought of
22245	conquest in the Pacific.
22246	
22247	The march of events, he added, had imposed new duties on the country.
22248	"Incidental to our tenure in the Philippines," he said, "is the
22249	commercial opportunity to which American statesmanship cannot be
22250	indifferent. It is just to use every legitimate means for the
22251	enlargement of American trade." On this ground he directed the
22252	commissioners to accept not less than the cession of the island of
22253	Luzon, the chief of the Philippine group, with its harbor of Manila. It
22254	was not until the latter part of October that he definitely instructed
22255	them to demand the entire archipelago, on the theory that the occupation
22256	of Luzon alone could not be justified "on political, commercial, or
22257	humanitarian grounds." This departure from the letter of the peace
22258	protocol was bitterly resented by the Spanish agents. It was with
22259	heaviness of heart that they surrendered the last sign of Spain's
22260	ancient dominion in the far Pacific.
22261	
22262	=The Final Terms of Peace.=--The treaty of peace, as finally agreed
22263	upon, embraced the following terms: the independence of Cuba; the
22264	cession of Porto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States;
22265	the settlement of claims filed by the citizens of both countries; the
22266	payment of twenty million dollars to Spain by the United States for the
22267	Philippines; and the determination of the status of the inhabitants of
22268	the ceded territories by Congress. The great decision had been made. Its
22269	issue was in the hands of the Senate where the Democrats and the
22270	Populists held the balance of power under the requirement of the
22271	two-thirds vote for ratification.
22272	
22273	=The Contest in America over the Treaty of Peace.=--The publication of
22274	the treaty committing the United States to the administration of distant
22275	colonies directed the shifting tides of public opinion into two distinct
22276	channels: support of the policy and opposition to it. The trend in
22277	Republican leadership, long in the direction marked out by the treaty,
22278	now came into the open. Perhaps a majority of the men highest in the
22279	councils of that party had undergone the change of heart reflected in
22280	the letters of John Hay, Secretary of State. In August of 1898 he had
22281	hinted, in a friendly letter to Andrew Carnegie, that he sympathized
22282	with the latter's opposition to "imperialism"; but he had added quickly:
22283	"The only question in my mind is how far it is now possible for us to
22284	withdraw from the Philippines." In November of the same year he wrote to
22285	Whitelaw Reid, one of the peace commissioners at Paris: "There is a wild
22286	and frantic attack now going on in the press against the whole
22287	Philippine transaction. Andrew Carnegie really seems to be off his
22288	head.... But all this confusion of tongues will go its way. The country
22289	will applaud the resolution that has been reached and you will return in
22290	the role of conquering heroes with your 'brows bound with oak.'"
22291	
22292	Senator Beveridge of Indiana and Senator Platt of Connecticut, accepting
22293	the verdict of history as the proof of manifest destiny, called for
22294	unquestioning support of the administration in its final step. "Every
22295	expansion of our territory," said the latter, "has been in accordance
22296	with the irresistible law of growth. We could no more resist the
22297	successive expansions by which we have grown to be the strongest nation
22298	on earth than a tree can resist its growth. The history of territorial
22299	expansion is the history of our nation's progress and glory. It is a
22300	matter to be proud of, not to lament. We should rejoice that Providence
22301	has given us the opportunity to extend our influence, our institutions,
22302	and our civilization into regions hitherto closed to us, rather than
22303	contrive how we can thwart its designs."
22304	
22305	This doctrine was savagely attacked by opponents of McKinley's policy,
22306	many a stanch Republican joining with the majority of Democrats in
22307	denouncing the treaty as a departure from the ideals of the republic.
22308	Senator Vest introduced in the Senate a resolution that "under the
22309	Constitution of the United States, no power is given to the federal
22310	Government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as
22311	colonies." Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, whose long and honorable
22312	career gave weight to his lightest words, inveighed against the whole
22313	procedure and to the end of his days believed that the new drift into
22314	rivalry with European nations as a colonial power was fraught with
22315	genuine danger. "Our imperialistic friends," he said, "seem to have
22316	forgotten the use of the vocabulary of liberty. They talk about giving
22317	good government. 'We shall give them such a government as we think they
22318	are fitted for.' 'We shall give them a better government than they had
22319	before.' Why, Mr. President, that one phrase conveys to a free man and a
22320	free people the most stinging of insults. In that little phrase, as in a
22321	seed, is contained the germ of all despotism and of all tyranny.
22322	Government is not a gift. Free government is not to be given by all the
22323	blended powers of earth and heaven. It is a birthright. It belongs, as
22324	our fathers said, and as their children said, as Jefferson said, and as
22325	President McKinley said, to human nature itself."
22326	
22327	The Senate, more conservative on the question of annexation than the
22328	House of Representatives composed of men freshly elected in the stirring
22329	campaign of 1896, was deliberate about ratification of the treaty. The
22330	Democrats and Populists were especially recalcitrant. Mr. Bryan hurried
22331	to Washington and brought his personal influence to bear in favor of
22332	speedy action. Patriotism required ratification, it was said in one
22333	quarter. The country desires peace and the Senate ought not to delay, it
22334	was urged in another. Finally, on February 6, 1899, the requisite
22335	majority of two-thirds was mustered, many a Senator who voted for the
22336	treaty, however, sharing the misgivings of Senator Hoar as to the
22337	"dangers of imperialism." Indeed at the time, the Senators passed a
22338	resolution declaring that the policy to be adopted in the Philippines
22339	was still an open question, leaving to the future, in this way, the
22340	possibility of retracing their steps.
22341	
22342	=The Attitude of England.=--The Spanish war, while accomplishing the
22343	simple objects of those who launched the nation on that course, like all
22344	other wars, produced results wholly unforeseen. In the first place, it
22345	exercised a profound influence on the drift of opinion among European
22346	powers. In England, sympathy with the United States was from the first
22347	positive and outspoken. "The state of feeling here," wrote Mr. Hay, then
22348	ambassador in London, "is the best I have ever known. From every quarter
22349	the evidences of it come to me. The royal family by habit and tradition
22350	are most careful not to break the rules of strict neutrality, but even
22351	among them I find nothing but hearty kindness and--so far as is
22352	consistent with propriety--sympathy. Among the political leaders on both
22353	sides I find not only sympathy but a somewhat eager desire that 'the
22354	other fellows' shall not seem more friendly."
22355	
22356	Joseph Chamberlain, the distinguished Liberal statesman, thinking no
22357	doubt of the continental situation, said in a political address at the
22358	very opening of the war that the next duty of Englishmen "is to
22359	establish and maintain bonds of permanent unity with our kinsmen across
22360	the Atlantic.... I even go so far as to say that, terrible as war may
22361	be, even war would be cheaply purchased if, in a great and noble cause,
22362	the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack should wave together over an
22363	Anglo-Saxon alliance." To the American ambassador he added
22364	significantly that he did not "care a hang what they say about it on the
22365	continent," which was another way of expressing the hope that the
22366	warning to Germany and France was sufficient. This friendly English
22367	opinion, so useful to the United States when a combination of powers to
22368	support Spain was more than possible, removed all fears as to the
22369	consequences of the war. Henry Adams, recalling days of humiliation in
22370	London during the Civil War, when his father was the American
22371	ambassador, coolly remarked that it was "the sudden appearance of
22372	Germany as the grizzly terror" that "frightened England into America's
22373	arms"; but the net result in keeping the field free for an easy triumph
22374	of American arms was none the less appreciated in Washington where,
22375	despite outward calm, fears of European complications were never absent.
22376	
22377	
22378	AMERICAN POLICIES IN THE PHILIPPINES AND THE ORIENT
22379	
22380	=The Filipino Revolt against American Rule.=--In the sphere of domestic
22381	politics, as well as in the field of foreign relations, the outcome of
22382	the Spanish war exercised a marked influence. It introduced at once
22383	problems of colonial administration and difficulties in adjusting trade
22384	relations with the outlying dominions. These were furthermore
22385	complicated in the very beginning by the outbreak of an insurrection
22386	against American sovereignty in the Philippines. The leader of the
22387	revolt, Aguinaldo, had been invited to join the American forces in
22388	overthrowing Spanish dominion, and he had assumed, apparently without
22389	warrant, that independence would be the result of the joint operations.
22390	When the news reached him that the American flag had been substituted
22391	for the Spanish flag, his resentment was keen. In February, 1899, there
22392	occurred a slight collision between his men and some American soldiers.
22393	The conflict thus begun was followed by serious fighting which finally
22394	dwindled into a vexatious guerrilla warfare lasting three years and
22395	costing heavily in men and money. Atrocities were committed by the
22396	native insurrectionists and, sad to relate, they were repaid in kind;
22397	it was argued in defense of the army that the ordinary rules of warfare
22398	were without terror to men accustomed to fighting like savages. In vain
22399	did McKinley assure the Filipinos that the institutions and laws
22400	established in the islands would be designed "not for our satisfaction
22401	or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness,
22402	peace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands." Nothing
22403	short of military pressure could bring the warring revolutionists to
22404	terms.
22405	
22406	=Attacks on Republican "Imperialism."=--The Filipino insurrection,
22407	following so quickly upon the ratification of the treaty with Spain,
22408	moved the American opponents of McKinley's colonial policies to redouble
22409	their denunciation of what they were pleased to call "imperialism."
22410	Senator Hoar was more than usually caustic in his indictment of the new
22411	course. The revolt against American rule did but convince him of the
22412	folly hidden in the first fateful measures. Everywhere he saw a
22413	conspiracy of silence and injustice. "I have failed to discover in the
22414	speeches, public or private, of the advocates of this war," he contended
22415	in the Senate, "or in the press which supports it and them, a single
22416	expression anywhere of a desire to do justice to the people of the
22417	Philippine Islands, or of a desire to make known to the people of the
22418	United States the truth of the case.... The catchwords, the cries, the
22419	pithy and pregnant phrases of which their speech is full, all mean
22420	dominion. They mean perpetual dominion.... There is not one of these
22421	gentlemen who will rise in his place and affirm that if he were a
22422	Filipino he would not do exactly as the Filipinos are doing; that he
22423	would not despise them if they were to do otherwise. So much at least
22424	they owe of respect to the dead and buried history--the dead and buried
22425	history so far as they can slay and bury it--of their country." In the
22426	way of practical suggestions, the Senator offered as a solution of the
22427	problem: the recognition of independence, assistance in establishing
22428	self-government, and an invitation to all powers to join in a guarantee
22429	of freedom to the islands.
22430	
22431	=The Republican Answer.=--To McKinley and his supporters, engaged in a
22432	sanguinary struggle to maintain American supremacy, such talk was more
22433	than quixotic; it was scarcely short of treasonable. They pointed out
22434	the practical obstacles in the way of uniform self-government for a
22435	collection of seven million people ranging in civilization from the most
22436	ignorant hill men to the highly cultivated inhabitants of Manila. The
22437	incidents of the revolt and its repression, they admitted, were painful
22438	enough; but still nothing as compared with the chaos that would follow
22439	the attempt of a people who had never had experience in such matters to
22440	set up and sustain democratic institutions. They preferred rather the
22441	gradual process of fitting the inhabitants of the islands for
22442	self-government. This course, in their eyes, though less poetic, was
22443	more in harmony with the ideals of humanity. Having set out upon it,
22444	they pursued it steadfastly to the end. First, they applied force
22445	without stint to the suppression of the revolt. Then they devoted such
22446	genius for colonial administration as they could command to the
22447	development of civil government, commerce, and industry.

22451	A PHILIPPINE HOME]
22452	
22453	=The Boxer Rebellion in China.=--For a nation with a world-wide trade,
22454	steadily growing, as the progress of home industries redoubled the zeal
22455	for new markets, isolation was obviously impossible. Never was this
22456	clearer than in 1900 when a native revolt against foreigners in China,
22457	known as the Boxer uprising, compelled the United States to join with
22458	the powers of Europe in a military expedition and a diplomatic
22459	settlement. The Boxers, a Chinese association, had for some time carried
22460	on a campaign of hatred against all aliens in the Celestial empire,
22461	calling upon the natives to rise in patriotic wrath and drive out the
22462	foreigners who, they said, "were lacerating China like tigers." In the
22463	summer of 1900 the revolt flamed up in deeds of cruelty. Missionaries
22464	and traders were murdered in the provinces; foreign legations were
22465	stoned; the German ambassador, one of the most cordially despised
22466	foreigners, was killed in the streets of Peking; and to all appearances
22467	a frightful war of extermination had begun. In the month of June nearly
22468	five hundred men, women, and children, representing all nations, were
22469	besieged in the British quarters in Peking under constant fire of
22470	Chinese guns and in peril of a terrible death.
22471	
22472	=Intervention in China.=--Nothing but the arrival of armed forces, made
22473	up of Japanese, Russian, British, American, French, and German soldiers
22474	and marines, prevented the destruction of the beleaguered aliens. When
22475	once the foreign troops were in possession of the Chinese capital,
22476	diplomatic questions of the most delicate character arose. For more than
22477	half a century, the imperial powers of Europe had been carving up the
22478	Chinese empire, taking to themselves territory, railway concessions,
22479	mining rights, ports, and commercial privileges at the expense of the
22480	huge but helpless victim. The United States alone among the great
22481	nations, while as zealous as any in the pursuit of peaceful trade, had
22482	refrained from seizing Chinese territory or ports. Moreover, the
22483	Department of State had been urging European countries to treat China
22484	with fairness, to respect her territorial integrity, and to give her
22485	equal trading privileges with all nations.
22486	
22487	=The American Policy of the "Open Door."=--In the autumn of 1899,
22488	Secretary Hay had addressed to London, Berlin, Rome, Paris, Tokyo, and
22489	St. Petersburg his famous note on the "open door" policy in China. In
22490	this document he proposed that existing treaty ports and vested
22491	interests of the several foreign countries should be respected; that
22492	the Chinese government should be permitted to extend its tariffs to all
22493	ports held by alien powers except the few free ports; and that there
22494	should be no discrimination in railway and port charges among the
22495	citizens of foreign countries operating in the empire. To these
22496	principles the governments addressed by Mr. Hay, finally acceded with
22497	evident reluctance.
22498	
22499	[Illustration: AMERICAN DOMINIONS IN THE PACIFIC]
22500	
22501	On this basis he then proposed the settlement that had to follow the
22502	Boxer uprising. "The policy of the Government of the United States," he
22503	said to the great powers, in the summer of 1900, "is to seek a solution
22504	which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve
22505	Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights
22506	guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and
22507	safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with
22508	all parts of the Chinese empire." This was a friendly warning to the
22509	world that the United States would not join in a scramble to punish the
22510	Chinese by carving out more territory. "The moment we acted," said Mr.
22511	Hay, "the rest of the world paused and finally came over to our ground;
22512	and the German government, which is generally brutal but seldom silly,
22513	recovered its senses, and climbed down off its perch."
22514	
22515	In taking this position, the Secretary of State did but reflect the
22516	common sense of America. "We are, of course," he explained, "opposed to
22517	the dismemberment of that empire and we do not think that the public
22518	opinion of the United States would justify this government in taking
22519	part in the great game of spoliation now going on." Heavy damages were
22520	collected by the European powers from China for the injuries inflicted
22521	upon their citizens by the Boxers; but the United States, finding the
22522	sum awarded in excess of the legitimate claims, returned the balance in
22523	the form of a fund to be applied to the education of Chinese students in
22524	American universities. "I would rather be, I think," said Mr. Hay, "the
22525	dupe of China than the chum of the Kaiser." By pursuing a liberal
22526	policy, he strengthened the hold of the United States upon the
22527	affections of the Chinese people and, in the long run, as he remarked
22528	himself, safeguarded "our great commercial interests in that Empire."
22529	
22530	=Imperialism in the Presidential Campaign of 1900.=--It is not strange
22531	that the policy pursued by the Republican administration in disposing of
22532	the questions raised by the Spanish War became one of the first issues
22533	in the presidential campaign of 1900. Anticipating attacks from every
22534	quarter, the Republicans, in renominating McKinley, set forth their
22535	position in clear and ringing phrases: "In accepting by the treaty of
22536	Paris the just responsibility of our victories in the Spanish War the
22537	President and Senate won the undoubted approval of the American people.
22538	No other course was possible than to destroy Spain's sovereignty
22539	throughout the West Indies and in the Philippine Islands. That course
22540	created our responsibility, before the world and with the unorganized
22541	population whom our intervention had freed from Spain, to provide for
22542	the maintenance of law and order, and for the establishment of good
22543	government and for the performance of international obligations. Our
22544	authority could not be less than our responsibility, and wherever
22545	sovereign rights were extended it became the high duty of the government
22546	to maintain its authority, to put down armed insurrection, and to confer
22547	the blessings of liberty and civilization upon all the rescued peoples.
22548	The largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and
22549	our duties shall be secured to them by law." To give more strength to
22550	their ticket, the Republican convention, in a whirlwind of enthusiasm,
22551	nominated for the vice presidency, against his protest, Theodore
22552	Roosevelt, the governor of New York and the hero of the Rough Riders, so
22553	popular on account of their Cuban campaign.
22554	
22555	The Democrats, as expected, picked up the gauntlet thrown down with such
22556	defiance by the Republicans. Mr. Bryan, whom they selected as their
22557	candidate, still clung to the currency issue; but the main emphasis,
22558	both of the platform and the appeal for votes, was on the "imperialistic
22559	program" of the Republican administration. The Democrats denounced the
22560	treatment of Cuba and Porto Rico and condemned the Philippine policy in
22561	sharp and vigorous terms. "As we are not willing," ran the platform, "to
22562	surrender our civilization or to convert the Republic into an empire, we
22563	favor an immediate declaration of the Nation's purpose to give to the
22564	Filipinos, first, a stable form of government; second, independence;
22565	third, protection from outside interference.... The greedy commercialism
22566	which dictated the Philippine policy of the Republican administration
22567	attempts to justify it with the plea that it will pay, but even this
22568	sordid and unworthy plea fails when brought to the test of facts. The
22569	war of 'criminal aggression' against the Filipinos entailing an annual
22570	expense of many millions has already cost more than any possible profit
22571	that could accrue from the entire Philippine trade for years to come....
22572	We oppose militarism. It means conquest abroad and intimidation and
22573	oppression at home. It means the strong arm which has ever been fatal to
22574	free institutions. It is what millions of our citizens have fled from in
22575	Europe. It will impose upon our peace-loving people a large standing
22576	army, an unnecessary burden of taxation, and would be a constant menace
22577	to their liberties." Such was the tenor of their appeal to the voters.
22578	
22579	With the issues clearly joined, the country rejected the Democratic
22580	candidate even more positively than four years before. The popular vote
22581	cast for McKinley was larger and that cast for Bryan smaller than in the
22582	silver election. Thus vindicated at the polls, McKinley turned with
22583	renewed confidence to the development of the policies he had so far
22584	advanced. But fate cut short his designs. In the September following his
22585	second inauguration, he was shot by an anarchist while attending the
22586	Buffalo exposition. "What a strange and tragic fate it has been of
22587	mine," wrote the Secretary of State, John Hay, on the day of the
22588	President's death, "to stand by the bier of three of my dearest friends,
22589	Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley, three of the gentlest of men, all risen
22590	to the head of the state and all done to death by assassins." On
22591	September 14, 1901, the Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt, took up the
22592	lines of power that had fallen from the hands of his distinguished
22593	chief, promising to continue "absolutely unbroken" the policies he had
22594	inherited.
22595	
22596	
22597	SUMMARY OF NATIONAL GROWTH AND WORLD POLITICS
22598	
22599	The economic aspects of the period between 1865 and 1900 may be readily
22600	summed up: the recovery of the South from the ruin of the Civil War, the
22601	extension of the railways, the development of the Great West, and the
22602	triumph of industry and business enterprise. In the South many of the
22603	great plantations were broken up and sold in small farms, crops were
22604	diversified, the small farming class was raised in the scale of social
22605	importance, the cotton industry was launched, and the coal, iron,
22606	timber, and other resources were brought into use. In the West the free
22607	arable land was practically exhausted by 1890 under the terms of the
22608	Homestead Act; gold, silver, copper, coal and other minerals were
22609	discovered in abundance; numerous rail connections were formed with the
22610	Atlantic seaboard; the cowboy and the Indian were swept away before a
22611	standardized civilization of electric lights and bathtubs. By the end of
22612	the century the American frontier had disappeared. The wild, primitive
22613	life so long associated with America was gone. The unity of the nation
22614	was established.
22615	
22616	In the field of business enterprise, progress was most marked. The
22617	industrial system, which had risen and flourished before the Civil War,
22618	grew into immense proportions and the industrial area was extended from
22619	the Northeast into all parts of the country. Small business concerns
22620	were transformed into huge corporations. Individual plants were merged
22621	under the management of gigantic trusts. Short railway lines were
22622	consolidated into national systems. The industrial population of
22623	wage-earners rose into the tens of millions. The immigration of aliens
22624	increased by leaps and bounds. The cities overshadowed the country. The
22625	nation that had once depended upon Europe for most of its manufactured
22626	goods became a competitor of Europe in the markets of the earth.
22627	
22628	In the sphere of politics, the period witnessed the recovery of white
22629	supremacy in the South; the continued discussion of the old questions,
22630	such as the currency, the tariff, and national banking; and the
22631	injection of new issues like the trusts and labor problems. As of old,
22632	foreign affairs were kept well at the front. Alaska was purchased from
22633	Russia; attempts were made to extend American influence in the Caribbean
22634	region; a Samoan island was brought under the flag; and the Hawaiian
22635	islands were annexed. The Monroe Doctrine was applied with vigor in the
22636	dispute between Venezuela and Great Britain.
22637	
22638	Assistance was given to the Cubans in their revolutionary struggle
22639	against Spain and thus there was precipitated a war which ended in the
22640	annexation of Porto Rico and the Philippines. American influence in the
22641	Pacific and the Orient was so enlarged as to be a factor of great weight
22642	in world affairs. Thus questions connected with foreign and "imperial"
22643	policies were united with domestic issues to make up the warp and woof
22644	of politics. In the direction of affairs, the Republicans took the
22645	leadership, for they held the presidency during all the years, except
22646	eight, between 1865 and 1900.

22749	
22750	THE EVOLUTION OF REPUBLICAN POLICIES (1901-13)
22751	
22752	
22753	=The Personality and Early Career of Roosevelt.=--On September 14, 1901,
22754	when Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office, the presidency passed
22755	to a new generation and a leader of a new type recalling, if comparisons
22756	must be made, Andrew Jackson rather than any Republican predecessor.
22757	Roosevelt was brusque, hearty, restless, and fond of action--"a young
22758	fellow of infinite dash and originality," as John Hay remarked of him;
22759	combining the spirit of his old college, Harvard, with the breezy
22760	freedom of the plains; interested in everything--a new species of game,
22761	a new book, a diplomatic riddle, or a novel theory of history or
22762	biology. Though only forty-three years old he was well versed in the art
22763	of practical politics. Coming upon the political scene in the early
22764	eighties, he had associated himself with the reformers in the Republican
22765	party; but he was no Mugwump. From the first he vehemently preached the
22766	doctrine of party loyalty; if beaten in the convention, he voted the
22767	straight ticket in the election. For twenty years he adhered to this
22768	rule and during a considerable portion of that period he held office as
22769	a spokesman of his party. He served in the New York legislature, as head
22770	of the metropolitan police force, as federal civil service commissioner
22771	under President Harrison, as assistant secretary of the navy under
22772	President McKinley, and as governor of the Empire state. Political
22773	managers of the old school spoke of him as "brilliant but erratic"; they
22774	soon found him equal to the shrewdest in negotiation and action.

22781	FOREIGN AFFAIRS
22782	
22783	=The Panama Canal.=--The most important foreign question confronting
22784	President Roosevelt on the day of his inauguration, that of the Panama
22785	Canal, was a heritage from his predecessor. The idea of a water route
22786	across the isthmus, long a dream of navigators, had become a living
22787	issue after the historic voyage of the battleship _Oregon_ around South
22788	America during the Spanish War. But before the United States could act
22789	it had to undo the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, made with Great Britain in
22790	1850, providing for the construction of the canal under joint
22791	supervision. This was finally effected by the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of
22792	1901 authorizing the United States to proceed alone, on condition that
22793	there should be no discriminations against other nations in the matter
22794	of rates and charges.
22795	
22796	This accomplished, it was necessary to decide just where the canal
22797	should be built. One group in Congress favored the route through
22798	Nicaragua; in fact, two official commissions had already approved that
22799	location. Another group favored cutting the way through Panama after
22800	purchasing the rights of the old French company which, under the
22801	direction of De Lesseps, the hero of the Suez Canal, had made a costly
22802	failure some twenty years before. After a heated argument over the
22803	merits of the two plans, preference was given to the Panama route. As
22804	the isthmus was then a part of Colombia, President Roosevelt proceeded
22805	to negotiate with the government at Bogota a treaty authorizing the
22806	United States to cut a canal through its territory. The treaty was
22807	easily framed, but it was rejected by the Colombian senate, much to the
22808	President's exasperation. "You could no more make an agreement with the
22809	Colombian rulers," he exclaimed, "than you could nail jelly to a wall."
22810	He was spared the necessity by a timely revolution. On November 3, 1903,
22811	Panama renounced its allegiance to Colombia and three days later the
22812	United States recognized its independence.
22813	
22814	[Illustration: _Courtesy of Panama Canal, Washington, D.C._

22816	DEEPEST EXCAVATED PORTION OF PANAMA CANAL, SHOWING GOLD HILL ON
22817	RIGHT AND CONTRACTOR'S HILL ON LEFT. JUNE, 1913]
22818	
22819	This amazing incident was followed shortly by the signature of a treaty
22820	between Panama and the United States in which the latter secured the
22821	right to construct the long-discussed canal, in return for a guarantee
22822	of independence and certain cash payments. The rights and property of
22823	the French concern were then bought, and the final details settled. A
22824	lock rather than a sea-level canal was agreed upon. Construction by the
22825	government directly instead of by private contractors was adopted.
22826	Scientific medicine was summoned to stamp out the tropical diseases
22827	that had made Panama a plague spot. Finally, in 1904, as the President
22828	said, "the dirt began to fly." After surmounting formidable
22829	difficulties--engineering, labor, and sanitary--the American forces in
22830	1913 joined the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific. Nearly eight
22831	thousand miles were cut off the sea voyage from New York to San
22832	Francisco. If any were inclined to criticize President Roosevelt for
22833	the way in which he snapped off negotiations with Colombia and
22834	recognized the Panama revolutionists, their attention was drawn to the
22835	magnificent outcome of the affair. Notwithstanding the treaty with Great
22836	Britain, Congress passed a tolls bill discriminating in rates in favor
22837	of American ships. It was only on the urgent insistence of President
22838	Wilson that the measure was later repealed.
22839	
22840	=The Conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War.=--The applause which greeted
22841	the President's next diplomatic stroke was unmarred by censure of any
22842	kind. In the winter of 1904 there broke out between Japan and Russia a
22843	terrible conflict over the division of spoils in Manchuria. The fortunes
22844	of war were with the agile forces of Nippon. In this struggle, it seems,
22845	President Roosevelt's sympathies were mainly with the Japanese, although
22846	he observed the proprieties of neutrality. At all events, Secretary Hay
22847	wrote in his diary on New Year's Day, 1905, that the President was
22848	"quite firm in his view that we cannot permit Japan to be robbed a
22849	second time of her victory," referring to the fact that Japan, ten years
22850	before, after defeating China on the field of battle, had been forced by
22851	Russia, Germany, and France to forego the fruits of conquest.
22852	
22853	Whatever the President's personal feelings may have been, he was aware
22854	that Japan, despite her triumphs over Russia, was staggering under a
22855	heavy burden of debt. At a suggestion from Tokyo, he invited both
22856	belligerents in the summer of 1905 to join in a peace conference. The
22857	celerity of their reply was aided by the pressure of European bankers,
22858	who had already come to a substantial agreement that the war must stop.
22859	After some delay, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was chosen as the meeting
22860	place for the spokesmen of the two warring powers. Roosevelt presided
22861	over the opening ceremonies with fine urbanity, thoroughly enjoying the
22862	justly earned honor of being for the moment at the center of the world's
22863	interest. He had the satisfaction of seeing the conference end in a
22864	treaty of peace and amity.
22865	
22866	=The Monroe Doctrine Applied to Germany.=--Less spectacular than the
22867	Russo-Japanese settlement but not less important was a diplomatic
22868	passage-at-arms with Germany over the Monroe Doctrine. This clash grew
22869	out of the inability or unwillingness of the Venezuelan government to
22870	pay debts due foreign creditors. Having exhausted their patience in
22871	negotiations, England and Germany, in December 1901, sent battleships to
22872	establish what they characterized as "a peaceful blockade" of Venezuelan
22873	ports. Their action was followed by the rupture of diplomatic relations;
22874	there was a possibility that war and the occupation of Venezuelan
22875	territory might result.
22876	
22877	While unwilling to stand between a Latin-American country and its
22878	creditors, President Roosevelt was determined that debt collecting
22879	should not be made an excuse for European countries to seize territory.
22880	He therefore urged arbitration of the dispute, winning the assent of
22881	England and Italy. Germany, with a somewhat haughty air, refused to take
22882	the milder course. The President, learning of this refusal, called the
22883	German ambassador to the White House and informed him in very precise
22884	terms that, unless the Imperial German Government consented to
22885	arbitrate, Admiral Dewey would be ordered to the scene with instructions
22886	to prevent Germany from seizing any Venezuelan territory. A week passed
22887	and no answer came from Berlin. Not baffled, the President again took
22888	the matter up with the ambassador, this time with even more firmness; he
22889	stated in language admitting of but one meaning that, unless within
22890	forty-eight hours the Emperor consented to arbitration, American
22891	battleships, already coaled and cleared, would sail for Venezuelan
22892	waters. The hint was sufficient. The Kaiser accepted the proposal and
22893	the President, with the fine irony of diplomacy, complimented him
22894	publicly on "being so stanch an advocate of arbitration." In terms of
22895	the Monroe Doctrine this action meant that the United States, while not
22896	denying the obligations of debtors, would not permit any move on the
22897	part of European powers that might easily lead to the temporary or
22898	permanent occupation of Latin-American territory.
22899	
22900	=The Santo Domingo Affair.=--The same issue was involved in a
22901	controversy over Santo Domingo which arose in 1904. The Dominican
22902	republic, like Venezuela, was heavily in debt, and certain European
22903	countries declared that, unless the United States undertook to look
22904	after the finances of the embarrassed debtor, they would resort to armed
22905	coercion. What was the United States to do? The danger of having some
22906	European power strongly intrenched in Santo Domingo was too imminent to
22907	be denied. President Roosevelt acted with characteristic speed, and
22908	notwithstanding strong opposition in the Senate was able, in 1907, to
22909	effect a treaty arrangement which placed Dominican finances under
22910	American supervision.
22911	
22912	In the course of the debate over this settlement, a number of
22913	interesting questions arose. It was pertinently asked whether the
22914	American navy should be used to help creditors collect their debts
22915	anywhere in Latin-America. It was suggested also that no sanction should
22916	be given to the practice among European governments of using armed force
22917	to collect private claims. Opponents of President Roosevelt's policy,
22918	and they were neither few nor insignificant, urged that such matters
22919	should be referred to the Hague Court or to special international
22920	commissions for arbitration. To this the answer was made that the United
22921	States could not surrender any question coming under the terms of the
22922	Monroe Doctrine to the decision of an international tribunal. The
22923	position of the administration was very clearly stated by President
22924	Roosevelt himself. "The country," he said, "would certainly decline to
22925	go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt;
22926	on the other hand, it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to
22927	take possession, even temporarily, of the customs houses of an American
22928	republic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations; for such a
22929	temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only
22930	escape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must
22931	ourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as
22932	possible of a just obligation shall be paid." The Monroe Doctrine was
22933	negative. It denied to European powers a certain liberty of operation in
22934	this hemisphere. The positive obligations resulting from its application
22935	by the United States were points now emphasized and developed.
22936	
22937	=The Hague Conference.=--The controversies over Latin-American relations
22938	and his part in bringing the Russo-Japanese War to a close naturally
22939	made a deep impression upon Roosevelt, turning his mind in the direction
22940	of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The subject was
22941	moreover in the air. As if conscious of impending calamity, the
22942	statesmen of the Old World, to all outward signs at least, seemed
22943	searching for a way to reduce armaments and avoid the bloody and costly
22944	trial of international causes by the ancient process of battle. It was
22945	the Czar, Nicholas II, fated to die in one of the terrible holocausts
22946	which he helped to bring upon mankind, who summoned the delegates of the
22947	nations in the first Hague Peace Conference in 1899. The conference did
22948	nothing to reduce military burdens or avoid wars but it did recognize
22949	the right of friendly nations to offer the services of mediation to
22950	countries at war and did establish a Court at the Hague for the
22951	arbitration of international disputes.
22952	
22953	Encouraged by this experiment, feeble as it was, President Roosevelt in
22954	1904 proposed a second conference, yielding to the Czar the honor of
22955	issuing the call. At this great international assembly, held at the
22956	Hague in 1907, the representatives of the United States proposed a plan
22957	for the compulsory arbitration of certain matters of international
22958	dispute. This was rejected with contempt by Germany. Reduction of
22959	armaments, likewise proposed in the conference, was again deferred. In
22960	fact, nothing was accomplished beyond agreement upon certain rules for
22961	the conduct of "civilized warfare," casting a somewhat lurid light upon
22962	the "pacific" intentions of most of the powers assembled.
22963	
22964	=The World Tour of the Fleet.=--As if to assure the world then that the
22965	United States placed little reliance upon the frail reed of peace
22966	conferences, Roosevelt the following year (1908) made an imposing
22967	display of American naval power by sending a fleet of sixteen
22968	battleships on a tour around the globe. On his own authority, he ordered
22969	the ships to sail out of Hampton Roads and circle the earth by way of
22970	the Straits of Magellan, San Francisco, Australia, the Philippines,
22971	China, Japan, and the Suez Canal. This enterprise was not, as some
22972	critics claimed, a "mere boyish flourish." President Roosevelt knew how
22973	deep was the influence of sea power on the fate of nations. He was aware
22974	that no country could have a wide empire of trade and dominion without
22975	force adequate to sustain it. The voyage around the world therefore
22976	served a double purpose. It interested his own country in the naval
22977	program of the government, and it reminded other powers that the
22978	American giant, though quiet, was not sleeping in the midst of
22979	international rivalries.
22980	
22981	
22982	COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION
22983	
22984	=A Constitutional Question Settled.=--In colonial administration, as in
22985	foreign policy, President Roosevelt advanced with firm step in a path
22986	already marked out. President McKinley had defined the principles that
22987	were to control the development of Porto Rico and the Philippines. The
22988	Republican party had announced a program of pacification, gradual
22989	self-government, and commercial improvement. The only remaining question
22990	of importance, to use the popular phrase,--"Does the Constitution follow
22991	the flag?"--had been answered by the Supreme Court of the United States.
22992	Although it was well known that the Constitution did not contemplate the
22993	government of dependencies, such as the Philippines and Porto Rico, the
22994	Court, by generous and ingenious interpretations, found a way for
22995	Congress to apply any reasonable rules required by the occasion.
22996	
22997	=Porto Rico.=--The government of Porto Rico was a relatively simple
22998	matter. It was a single island with a fairly homogeneous population
22999	apart from the Spanish upper class. For a time after military occupation
23000	in 1898, it was administered under military rule. This was succeeded by
23001	the establishment of civil government under the "organic act" passed by
23002	Congress in 1900. The law assured to the Porto Ricans American
23003	protection but withheld American citizenship--a boon finally granted in
23004	1917. It provided for a governor and six executive secretaries appointed
23005	by the President with the approval of the Senate; and for a legislature
23006	of two houses--one elected by popular native vote, and an upper chamber
23007	composed of the executive secretaries and five other persons appointed
23008	in the same manner. Thus the United States turned back to the provincial
23009	system maintained by England in Virginia or New York in old colonial
23010	days. The natives were given a voice in their government and the power
23011	of initiating laws; but the final word both in law-making and
23012	administration was vested in officers appointed in Washington. Such was
23013	the plan under which the affairs of Porto Rico were conducted by
23014	President Roosevelt. It lasted until the new organic act of 1917.

23019	
23020	=The Philippines.=--The administration of the Philippines presented far
23021	more difficult questions. The number of islands, the variety of
23022	languages and races, the differences in civilization all combined to
23023	challenge the skill of the government. Moreover, there was raging in
23024	1901 a stubborn revolt against American authority, which had to be
23025	faced. Following the lines laid down by President McKinley, the
23026	evolution of American policy fell into three stages. At first the
23027	islands were governed directly by the President under his supreme
23028	military power. In 1901 a civilian commission, headed by William Howard
23029	Taft, was selected by the President and charged with the government of
23030	the provinces in which order had been restored. Six years later, under
23031	the terms of an organic act, passed by Congress in 1902, the third stage
23032	was reached. The local government passed into the hands of a governor
23033	and commission, appointed by the President and Senate, and a
23034	legislature--one house elected by popular vote and an upper chamber
23035	
23036	composed of the commission. This scheme, like that obtaining in Porto
23037	Rico, remained intact until a Democratic Congress under President
23038	Wilson's leadership carried the colonial administration into its fourth
23039	phase by making both houses elective. Thus, by the steady pursuit of a
23040	liberal policy, self-government was extended to the dependencies; but it
23041	encouraged rather than extinguished the vigorous movement among the
23042	Philippine natives for independence.

23047	
23048	=Cuban Relations.=--Within the sphere of colonial affairs, Cuba, though
23049	nominally independent, also presented problems to the government at
23050	Washington. In the fine enthusiasm that accompanied the declaration of
23051	war on Spain, Congress, unmindful of practical considerations,
23052	recognized the independence of Cuba and disclaimed "any disposition or
23053	intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said
23054	island except for the pacification thereof." In the settlement that
23055	followed the war, however, it was deemed undesirable to set the young
23056	republic adrift upon the stormy sea of international politics without a
23057	guiding hand. Before withdrawing American troops from the island,
23058	Congress, in March, 1901, enacted, and required Cuba to approve, a
23059	series of restrictions known as the Platt amendment, limiting her power
23060	to incur indebtedness, securing the right of the United States to
23061	intervene whenever necessary to protect life and property, and reserving
23062	to the United States coaling stations at certain points to be agreed
23063	upon. The Cubans made strong protests against what they deemed
23064	"infringements of their sovereignty"; but finally with good grace
23065	accepted their fate. Even when in 1906 President Roosevelt landed
23066	American troops in the island to quell a domestic dissension, they
23067	acquiesced in the action, evidently regarding it as a distinct warning
23068	that they should learn to manage their elections in an orderly manner.
23069	
23070	
23071	THE ROOSEVELT DOMESTIC POLICIES
23072	
23073	=Social Questions to the Front.=--From the day of his inauguration to
23074	the close of his service in 1909, President Roosevelt, in messages,
23075	speeches, and interviews, kept up a lively and interesting discussion of
23076	trusts, capital, labor, poverty, riches, lawbreaking, good citizenship,
23077	and kindred themes. Many a subject previously touched upon only by
23078	representatives of the minor and dissenting parties, he dignified by a
23079	careful examination. That he did this with any fixed design or policy in
23080	mind does not seem to be the case. He admitted himself that when he
23081	became President he did not have in hand any settled or far-reaching
23082	plan of social betterment. He did have, however, serious convictions on
23083	general principles. "I was bent upon making the government," he wrote,
23084	"the most efficient possible instrument in helping the people of the
23085	United States to better themselves in every way, politically, socially,
23086	and industrially. I believed with all my heart in real and
23087	thorough-going democracy and I wished to make the democracy industrial
23088	as well as political, although I had only partially formulated the
23089	method I believed we should follow." It is thus evident at least that he
23090	had departed a long way from the old idea of the government as nothing
23091	but a great policeman keeping order among the people in a struggle over
23092	the distribution of the nation's wealth and resources.
23093	
23094	=Roosevelt's View of the Constitution.=--Equally significant was
23095	Roosevelt's attitude toward the Constitution and the office of
23096	President. He utterly repudiated the narrow construction of our national
23097	charter. He held that the Constitution "should be treated as the
23098	greatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid a people in
23099	exercising every power necessary for its own betterment, not as a
23100	strait-jacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth." He viewed the
23101	presidency as he did the Constitution. Strict constructionists of the
23102	Jeffersonian school, of whom there were many on occasion even in the
23103	Republican party, had taken a view that the President could do nothing
23104	that he was not specifically authorized by the Constitution to do.
23105	Roosevelt took exactly the opposite position. It was his opinion that it
23106	was not only the President's right but his duty "to do anything that the
23107	needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the
23108	Constitution or the laws." He went on to say that he acted "for the
23109	common well-being of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was
23110	necessary, unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative
23111	prohibition."
23112	
23113	=The Trusts and Railways.=--To the trust question, Roosevelt devoted
23114	especial attention. This was unavoidable. By far the larger part of the
23115	business of the country was done by corporations as distinguished from
23116	partnerships and individual owners. The growth of these gigantic
23117	aggregations of capital had been the leading feature in American
23118	industrial development during the last two decades of the nineteenth
23119	century. In the conquest of business by trusts and "the resulting
23120	private fortunes of great magnitude," the Populists and the Democrats
23121	had seen a grievous danger to the republic. "Plutocracy has taken the
23122	place of democracy; the tariff breeds trusts; let us destroy therefore
23123	the tariff and the trusts"--such was the battle cry which had been taken
23124	up by Bryan and his followers.
23125	
23126	President Roosevelt countered vigorously. He rejected the idea that the
23127	trusts were the product of the tariff or of governmental action of any
23128	kind. He insisted that they were the outcome of "natural economic
23129	forces": (1) destructive competition among business men compelling them
23130	to avoid ruin by cooperation in fixing prices; (2) the growth of markets
23131	on a national scale and even international scale calling for vast
23132	accumulations of capital to carry on such business; (3) the possibility
23133	of immense savings by the union of many plants under one management. In
23134	the corporation he saw a new stage in the development of American
23135	industry. Unregulated competition he regarded as "the source of evils
23136	which all men concede must be remedied if this civilization of ours is
23137	to survive." The notion, therefore, that these immense business concerns
23138	should be or could be broken up by a decree of law, Roosevelt considered
23139	absurd.
23140	
23141	At the same time he proposed that "evil trusts" should be prevented from
23142	"wrong-doing of any kind"; that is, punished for plain swindling, for
23143	making agreements to limit output, for refusing to sell to customers who
23144	dealt with rival firms, and for conspiracies with railways to ruin
23145	competitors by charging high freight rates and for similar abuses.
23146	Accordingly, he proposed, not the destruction of the trusts, but their
23147	regulation by the government. This, he contended, would preserve the
23148	advantages of business on a national scale while preventing the evils
23149	that accompanied it. The railway company he declared to be a public
23150	servant. "Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike."
23151	So he answered those who thought that trusts and railway combinations
23152	were private concerns to be managed solely by their owners without let
23153	or hindrance and also those who thought trusts and railway combinations
23154	could be abolished by tariff reduction or criminal prosecution.
23155	
23156	=The Labor Question.=--On the labor question, then pressing to the front
23157	in public interest, President Roosevelt took advanced ground for his
23158	time. He declared that the working-man, single-handed and empty-handed,
23159	threatened with starvation if unemployed, was no match for the employer
23160	who was able to bargain and wait. This led him, accordingly, to accept
23161	the principle of the trade union; namely, that only by collective
23162	bargaining can labor be put on a footing to measure its strength equally
23163	with capital. While he severely arraigned labor leaders who advocated
23164	violence and destructive doctrines, he held that "the organization of
23165	labor into trade unions and federations is necessary, is beneficent, and
23166	is one of the greatest possible agencies in the attainment of a true
23167	industrial, as well as a true political, democracy in the United
23168	States." The last resort of trade unions in labor disputes, the strike,
23169	he approved in case negotiations failed to secure "a fair deal."
23170	
23171	He thought, however, that labor organizations, even if wisely managed,
23172	could not solve all the pressing social questions of the time. The aid
23173	of the government at many points he believed to be necessary to
23174	eliminate undeserved poverty, industrial diseases, unemployment, and the
23175	unfortunate consequences of industrial accidents. In his first message
23176	of 1901, for instance, he urged that workers injured in industry should
23177	have certain and ample compensation. From time to time he advocated
23178	other legislation to obtain what he called "a larger measure of social
23179	and industrial justice."
23180	
23181	=Great Riches and Taxation.=--Even the challenge of the radicals, such
23182	as the Populists, who alleged that "the toil of millions is boldly
23183	stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few"--challenges which his
23184	predecessors did not consider worthy of notice--President Roosevelt
23185	refused to let pass without an answer. In his first message he denied
23186	the truth of the common saying that the rich were growing richer and the
23187	poor were growing poorer. He asserted that, on the contrary, the average
23188	man, wage worker, farmer, and small business man, was better off than
23189	ever before in the history of our country. That there had been abuses in
23190	the accumulation of wealth he did not pretend to ignore, but he believed
23191	that even immense fortunes, on the whole, represented positive benefits
23192	conferred upon the country. Nevertheless he felt that grave dangers to
23193	the safety and the happiness of the people lurked in great inequalities
23194	of wealth. In 1906 he wrote that he wished it were in his power to
23195	prevent the heaping up of enormous fortunes. The next year, to the
23196	astonishment of many leaders in his own party, he boldly announced in a
23197	message to Congress that he approved both income and inheritance taxes,
23198	then generally viewed as Populist or Democratic measures. He even took
23199	the stand that such taxes should be laid in order to bring about a more
23200	equitable distribution of wealth and greater equality of opportunity
23201	among citizens.
23202	
23203	
23204	LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ACTIVITIES
23205	
23206	=Economic Legislation.=--When President Roosevelt turned from the field
23207	of opinion he found himself in a different sphere. Many of his views
23208	were too advanced for the members of his party in Congress, and where
23209	results depended upon the making of new laws, his progress was slow.
23210	Nevertheless, in his administrations several measures were enacted that
23211	bore the stamp of his theories, though it could hardly be said that he
23212	dominated Congress to the same degree as did some other Presidents. The
23213	Hepburn Railway Act of 1906 enlarged the interstate commerce commission;
23214	it extended the commission's power over oil pipe lines, express
23215	companies, and other interstate carriers; it gave the commission the
23216	right to reduce rates found to be unreasonable and discriminatory; it
23217	forbade "midnight tariffs," that is, sudden changes in rates favoring
23218	certain shippers; and it prohibited common carriers from transporting
23219	goods owned by themselves, especially coal, except for their own proper
23220	use. Two important pure food and drug laws, enacted during the same
23221	year, were designed to protect the public against diseased meats and
23222	deleterious foods and drugs. A significant piece of labor legislation
23223	was an act of the same Congress making interstate railways liable to
23224	damages for injuries sustained by their employees. When this measure was
23225	declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court it was reenacted with the
23226	objectionable clauses removed. A second installment of labor legislation
23227	was offered in the law of 1908 limiting the hours of railway employees
23228	engaged as trainmen or telegraph operators.

23233	
23234	=Reclamation and Conservation.=--The open country--the deserts, the
23235	forests, waterways, and the public lands--interested President Roosevelt
23236	no less than railway and industrial questions. Indeed, in his first
23237	message to Congress he placed the conservation of natural resources
23238	among "the most vital internal problems" of the age, and forcibly
23239	emphasized an issue that had been discussed in a casual way since
23240	Cleveland's first administration. The suggestion evoked an immediate
23241	response in Congress. Under the leadership of Senator Newlands, of
23242	Nevada, the Reclamation Act of 1902 was passed, providing for the
23243	redemption of the desert areas of the West. The proceeds from the sale
23244	of public lands were dedicated to the construction of storage dams and
23245	sluiceways to hold water and divert it as needed to the thirsty sands.
23246	Furthermore it was stipulated that the rents paid by water users should
23247	go into a reclamation fund to continue the good work forever.
23248	Construction was started immediately under the terms of the law. Within
23249	seventeen years about 1,600,000 acres had been reclaimed and more than a
23250	million were actually irrigated. In the single year 1918, the crops of
23251	the irrigated districts were valued at approximately $100,000,000.
23252	
23253	In his first message, also, President Roosevelt urged the transfer of
23254	all control over national forests to trained men in the Bureau of
23255	Forestry--a recommendation carried out in 1907 when the Forestry Service
23256	was created. In every direction noteworthy advances were made in the
23257	administration of the national domain. The science of forestry was
23258	improved and knowledge of the subject spread among the people. Lands in
23259	the national forest available for agriculture were opened to settlers.
23260	Water power sites on the public domain were leased for a term of years
23261	to private companies instead of being sold outright. The area of the
23262	national forests was enlarged from 43 million acres to 194 million acres
23263	by presidential proclamation--more than 43 million acres being added in
23264	one year, 1907. The men who turned sheep and cattle to graze on the
23265	public lands were compelled to pay a fair rental, much to their
23266	dissatisfaction. Fire prevention work was undertaken in the forests on a
23267	large scale, reducing the appalling, annual destruction of timber.
23268	Millions of acres of coal land, such as the government had been
23269	carelessly selling to mining companies at low figures, were withdrawn
23270	from sale and held until Congress was prepared to enact laws for the
23271	disposition of them in the public interest. Prosecutions were
23272	instituted against men who had obtained public lands by fraud and vast
23273	tracts were recovered for the national domain. An agitation was begun
23274	which bore fruit under the administrations of Taft and Wilson in laws
23275	reserving to the federal government the ownership of coal, water power,
23276	phosphates, and other natural resources while authorizing corporations
23277	to develop them under leases for a period of years.
23278	
23279	=The Prosecution of the Trusts.=--As an executive, President Roosevelt
23280	was also a distinct "personality." His discrimination between "good" and
23281	"bad" trusts led him to prosecute some of them with vigor. On his
23282	initiative, the Northern Securities Company, formed to obtain control of
23283	certain great western railways, was dissolved by order of the Supreme
23284	Court. Proceedings were instituted against the American Tobacco Company
23285	and the Standard Oil Company as monopolies in violation of the Sherman
23286	Anti-Trust law. The Sugar Trust was found guilty of cheating the New
23287	York customs house and some of the minor officers were sent to prison.
23288	Frauds in the Post-office Department were uncovered and the offenders
23289	brought to book. In fact hardly a week passed without stirring news of
23290	"wrong doers" and "malefactors" haled into federal courts.
23291	
23292	=The Great Coal Strike.=--The Roosevelt theory that the President could
23293	do anything for public welfare not forbidden by the Constitution and the
23294	laws was put to a severe test in 1902. A strike of the anthracite coal
23295	miners, which started in the summer, ran late into the autumn.
23296	Industries were paralyzed for the want of coal; cities were threatened
23297	with the appalling menace of a winter without heat. Governors and mayors
23298	were powerless and appealed for aid. The mine owners rejected the
23299	demands of the men and refused to permit the arbitration of the points
23300	in dispute, although John Mitchell, the leader of the miners, repeatedly
23301	urged it. After observing closely the course affairs, President
23302	Roosevelt made up his mind that the situation was intolerable. He
23303	arranged to have the federal troops, if necessary, take possession of
23304	the mines and operate them until the strike could be settled. He then
23305	invited the contestants to the White House and by dint of hard labor
23306	induced them to accept, as a substitute or compromise, arbitration by a
23307	commission which he appointed. Thus, by stepping outside the
23308	Constitution and acting as the first citizen of the land, President
23309	Roosevelt averted a crisis of great magnitude.
23310	
23311	=The Election of 1904.=--The views and measures which he advocated with
23312	such vigor aroused deep hostility within as well as without his party.
23313	There were rumors of a Republican movement to defeat his nomination in
23314	1904 and it was said that the "financial and corporation interests" were
23315	in arms against him. A prominent Republican paper in New York City
23316	accused him of having "stolen Mr. Bryan's thunder," by harrying the
23317	trusts and favoring labor unions. When the Republican convention
23318	assembled in Chicago, however, the opposition disappeared and Roosevelt
23319	was nominated by acclamation.
23320	
23321	This was the signal for a change on the part of Democratic leaders. They
23322	denounced the President as erratic, dangerous, and radical and decided
23323	to assume the moderate role themselves. They put aside Mr. Bryan and
23324	selected as their candidate, Judge Alton B. Parker, of New York, a man
23325	
23326	who repudiated free silver and made a direct appeal for the conservative
23327	vote. The outcome of the reversal was astounding. Judge Parker's vote
23328	fell more than a million below that cast for Bryan in 1900; of the 476
23329	electoral votes he received only 140. Roosevelt, in addition to sweeping
23330	the Republican sections, even invaded Democratic territory, carrying the
23331	state of Missouri. Thus vindicated at the polls, he became more
23332	outspoken than ever. His leadership in the party was so widely
23333	recognized that he virtually selected his own successor.
23334	
23335	
23336	THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT TAFT
23337	
23338	=The Campaign of 1908.=--Long before the end of his elective term,
23339	President Roosevelt let it be known that he favored as his successor,
23340	William Howard Taft, of Ohio, his Secretary of War. To attain this end
23341	he used every shred of his powerful influence. When the Republican
23342	convention assembled, Mr. Taft easily won the nomination. Though the
23343	party platform was conservative in tone, he gave it a progressive tinge
23344	by expressing his personal belief in the popular election of United
23345	States Senators, an income tax, and other liberal measures. President
23346	Roosevelt announced his faith in the Republican candidate and appealed
23347	to the country for his election.
23348	
23349	The turn in Republican affairs now convinced Mr. Bryan that the signs
23350	were propitious for a third attempt to win the presidency. The disaster
23351	to Judge Parker had taught the party that victory did not lie in a
23352	conservative policy. With little difficulty, therefore, the veteran
23353	leader from Nebraska once more rallied the Democrats around his
23354	standard, won the nomination, and wrote a platform vigorously attacking
23355	the tariff, trusts, and monopolies. Supported by a loyal following, he
23356	entered the lists, only to meet another defeat. Though he polled almost
23357	a million and a half more votes than did Judge Parker in 1904, the palm
23358	went to Mr. Taft.
23359	
23360	=The Tariff Revision and Party Dissensions.=--At the very beginning of
23361	his term, President Taft had to face the tariff issue. He had met it in
23362	the campaign. Moved by the Democratic demand for a drastic reduction, he
23363	had expressed opinions which were thought to imply a "downward
23364	revision." The Democrats made much of the implication and the
23365	Republicans from the Middle West rejoiced in it. Pressure was coming
23366	from all sides. More than ten years had elapsed since the enactment of
23367	the Dingley bill and the position of many industries had been altered
23368	with the course of time. Evidently the day for revision--at best a
23369	thankless task--had arrived. Taft accepted the inevitable and called
23370	Congress in a special session. Until the midsummer of 1909, Republican
23371	Senators and Representatives wrangled over tariff schedules, the
23372	President making little effort to influence their decisions. When on
23373	August 5 the Payne-Aldrich bill became a law, a breach had been made in
23374	Republican ranks. Powerful Senators from the Middle West had spoken
23375	angrily against many of the high rates imposed by the bill. They had
23376	even broken with their party colleagues to vote against the entire
23377	scheme of tariff revision.
23378	
23379	=The Income Tax Amendment.=--The rift in party harmony was widened by
23380	another serious difference of opinion. During the debate on the tariff
23381	bill, there was a concerted movement to include in it an income tax
23382	provision--this in spite of the decision of the Supreme Court in 1895
23383	declaring it unconstitutional. Conservative men were alarmed by the
23384	evident willingness of some members to flout a solemn decree of that
23385	eminent tribunal. At the same time they saw a powerful combination of
23386	Republicans and Democrats determined upon shifting some of the burden of
23387	taxation to large incomes. In the press of circumstances, a compromise
23388	was reached. The income tax bill was dropped for the present; but
23389	Congress passed the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution, authorizing
23390	taxes upon incomes from whatever source they might be derived, without
23391	reference to any apportionment among the states on the basis of
23392	population. The states ratified the amendment and early in 1913 it was
23393	proclaimed.
23394	
23395	=President Taft's Policies.=--After the enactment of the tariff bill,
23396	Taft continued to push forward with his legislative program. He
23397	recommended, and Congress created, a special court of commerce with
23398	jurisdiction, among other things, over appeals from the interstate
23399	commerce commission, thus facilitating judicial review of the railway
23400	rates fixed and the orders issued by that body. This measure was quickly
23401	followed by an act establishing a system of postal savings banks in
23402	connection with the post office--a scheme which had long been opposed by
23403	private banks. Two years later, Congress defied the lobby of the express
23404	companies and supplemented the savings banks with a parcels post system,
23405	thus enabling the American postal service to catch up with that of other
23406	progressive nations. With a view to improving the business
23407	administration of the federal government, the President obtained from
23408	Congress a large appropriation for an economy and efficiency commission
23409	charged with the duty of inquiring into wasteful and obsolete methods
23410	and recommending improved devices and practices. The chief result of
23411	this investigation was a vigorous report in favor of a national budget
23412	system, which soon found public backing.
23413	
23414	President Taft negotiated with England and France general treaties
23415	providing for the arbitration of disputes which were "justiciable" in
23416	character even though they might involve questions of "vital interest
23417	and national honor." They were coldly received in the Senate and so
23418	amended that Taft abandoned them altogether. A tariff reciprocity
23419	agreement with Canada, however, he forced through Congress in the face
23420	of strong opposition from his own party. After making a serious breach
23421	in Republican ranks, he was chagrined to see the whole scheme come to
23422	naught by the overthrow of the Liberals in the Canadian elections of
23423	1911.
23424	
23425	=Prosecution of the Trusts.=--The party schism was even enlarged by what
23426	appeared to be the successful prosecution of several great combinations.
23427	In two important cases, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the
23428	Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company on the ground that
23429	they violated the Sherman Anti-Trust law. In taking this step Chief
23430	Justice White was at some pains to state that the law did not apply to
23431	combinations which did not "unduly" restrain trade. His remark,
23432	construed to mean that the Court would not interfere with corporations
23433	as such, became the subject of a popular outcry against the President
23434	and the judges.
23435	
23436	
23437	PROGRESSIVE INSURGENCY AND THE ELECTION OF 1912
23438	
23439	=Growing Dissensions.=--All in all, Taft's administration from the first
23440	day had been disturbed by party discord. High words had passed over the
23441	tariff bill and disgruntled members of Congress could not forget them.
23442	To differences over issues were added quarrels between youth and old
23443	age. In the House of Representatives there developed a group of young
23444	"insurgent" Republicans who resented the dominance of the Speaker,
23445	Joseph G. Cannon, and other members of the "old guard," as they named
23446	the men of long service and conservative minds. In 1910, the insurgents
23447	went so far as to join with the Democrats in a movement to break the
23448	Speaker's sway by ousting him from the rules committee and depriving him
23449	of the power to appoint its members. The storm was brewing. In the
23450	autumn of that year the Democrats won a clear majority in the House of
23451	Representatives and began an open battle with President Taft by
23452	demanding an immediate downward revision of the tariff.
23453	
23454	=The Rise of the Progressive Republicans.=--Preparatory to the campaign
23455	of 1912, the dissenters within the Republican party added the prefix
23456	"Progressive" to their old title and began to organize a movement to
23457	prevent the renomination of Mr. Taft. As early as January 21, 1911, they
23458	formed a Progressive Republican League at the home of Senator La
23459	Follette of Wisconsin and launched an attack on the Taft measures and
23460	policies. In October they indorsed Mr. La Follette as "the logical
23461	Republican candidate" and appealed to the party for support. The
23462	controversy over the tariff had grown into a formidable revolt against
23463	the occupant of the White House.
23464	
23465	=Roosevelt in the Field.=--After looking on for a while, ex-President
23466	Roosevelt took a hand in the fray. Soon after his return in 1910 from a
23467	hunting trip in Africa and a tour in Europe, he made a series of
23468	addresses in which he formulated a progressive program. In a speech in
23469	Kansas, he favored regulation of the trusts, a graduated income tax
23470	bearing heavily on great fortunes, tariff revision schedule by schedule,
23471	conservation of natural resources, labor legislation, the direct
23472	primary, and the recall of elective officials. In an address before the
23473	Ohio state constitutional convention in February, 1912, he indorsed the
23474	initiative and referendum and announced a doctrine known as the "recall
23475	of judicial decisions." This was a new and radical note in American
23476	politics. An ex-President of the United States proposed that the people
23477	at the polls should have the right to reverse the decision of a judge
23478	who set aside any act of a state legislature passed in the interests of
23479	social welfare. The Progressive Republicans, impressed by these
23480	addresses, turned from La Follette to Roosevelt and on February 24,
23481	induced him to come out openly as a candidate against Taft for the
23482	Republican nomination.
23483	
23484	=The Split in the Republican Party.=--The country then witnessed the
23485	strange spectacle of two men who had once been close companions engaged
23486	in a bitter rivalry to secure a majority of the delegates to the
23487	Republican convention to be held at Chicago. When the convention
23488	assembled, about one-fourth of the seats were contested, the delegates
23489	for both candidates loudly proclaiming the regularity of their election.
23490	In deciding between the contestants the national committee, after the
23491	usual hearings, settled the disputes in such a way that Taft received a
23492	safe majority. After a week of negotiation, Roosevelt and his followers
23493	left the Republican party. Most of his supporters withdrew from the
23494	convention and the few who remained behind refused to answer the roll
23495	call. Undisturbed by this formidable bolt, the regular Republicans went
23496	on with their work. They renominated Mr. Taft and put forth a platform
23497	roundly condemning such Progressive doctrines as the recall of judges.
23498	
23499	=The Formation of the Progressive Party.=--The action of the Republicans
23500	in seating the Taft delegates was vigorously denounced by Roosevelt. He
23501	declared that the convention had no claim to represent the voters of the
23502	Republican party; that any candidate named by it would be "the
23503	beneficiary of a successful fraud"; and that it would be deeply
23504	discreditable to any man to accept the convention's approval under such
23505	circumstances. The bitterness of his followers was extreme. On July 8, a
23506	call went forth for a "Progressive" convention to be held in Chicago on
23507	August 5. The assembly which duly met on that day was a unique political
23508	conference. Prominence was given to women delegates, and "politicians"
23509	were notably absent. Roosevelt himself, who was cheered as a conquering
23510	hero, made an impassioned speech setting forth his "confession of
23511	faith." He was nominated by acclamation; Governor Hiram Johnson of
23512	California was selected as his companion candidate for Vice President.
23513	The platform endorsed such political reforms as woman suffrage, direct
23514	primaries, the initiative, referendum, and recall, popular election of
23515	United States Senators, and the short ballot. It favored a program of
23516	social legislation, including the prohibition of child labor and minimum
23517	wages for women. It approved the regulation, rather than the
23518	dissolution, of the trusts. Like apostles in a new and lofty cause, the
23519	Progressives entered a vigorous campaign for the election of their
23520	distinguished leader.
23521	
23522	=Woodrow Wilson and the Election of 1912.=--With the Republicans
23523	divided, victory loomed up before the Democrats. Naturally, a terrific
23524	contest over the nomination occurred at their convention in Baltimore.
23525	Champ Clark, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Governor
23526	Woodrow Wilson, of New Jersey, were the chief contestants. After tossing
23527	to and fro for seven long, hot days, and taking forty-six ballots, the
23528	delegates, powerfully influenced by Mr. Bryan, finally decided in favor
23529	of the governor. As a professor, a writer on historical and political
23530	subjects, and the president of Princeton University, Mr. Wilson had
23531	become widely known in public life. As the governor of New Jersey he had
23532	attracted the support of the progressives in both parties. With grim
23533	determination he had "waged war on the bosses," and pushed through the
23534	legislature measures establishing direct primaries, regulating public
23535	utilities, and creating a system of workmen's compensation in
23536	industries. During the presidential campaign that followed Governor
23537	Wilson toured the country and aroused great enthusiasm by a series of
23538	addresses later published under the title of _The New Freedom_. He
23539	declared that "the government of the United States is at present the
23540	foster child of the special interests." He proposed to free the country
23541	by breaking the dominance of "the big bankers, the big manufacturers,
23542	the big masters of commerce, the heads of railroad corporations and of
23543	steamship corporations."
23544	
23545	In the election Governor Wilson easily secured a majority of the
23546	electoral votes, and his party, while retaining possession of the House
23547	of Representatives, captured the Senate as well. The popular verdict,
23548	however, indicated a state of confusion in the country. The combined
23549	Progressive and Republican vote exceeded that of the Democrats by
23550	1,300,000. The Socialists, with Eugene V. Debs as their candidate again,
23551	polled about 900,000 votes, more than double the number received four
23552	years before. Thus, as the result of an extraordinary upheaval the
23553	Republicans, after holding the office of President for sixteen years,
23554	passed out of power, and the government of the country was intrusted to
23555	the Democrats under the leadership of a man destined to be one of the
23556	outstanding figures of the modern age, Woodrow Wilson.

23656	CHAPTER XXII
23657	
23658	THE SPIRIT OF REFORM IN AMERICA
23659	
23660	
23661	AN AGE OF CRITICISM
23662	
23663	=Attacks on Abuses in American Life.=--The crisis precipitated by the
23664	Progressive uprising was not a sudden and unexpected one. It had been
23665	long in preparation. The revolt against corruption in politics which
23666	produced the Liberal Republican outbreak in the seventies and the
23667	Mugwump movement of the eighties was followed by continuous criticism of
23668	American political and economic development. From 1880 until his death
23669	in 1892, George William Curtis, as president of the Civil Service Reform
23670	Association, kept up a running fire upon the abuses of the spoils
23671	system. James Bryce, an observant English scholar and man of affairs, in
23672	his great work, _The American Commonwealth_, published in 1888, by
23673	picturing fearlessly the political rings and machines which dominated
23674	the cities, gave the whole country a fresh shock. Six years later Henry
23675	D. Lloyd, in a powerful book entitled _Wealth against Commonwealth_,
23676	attacked in scathing language certain trusts which had destroyed their
23677	rivals and bribed public officials. In 1903 Miss Ida Tarbell, an author
23678	of established reputation in the historical field, gave to the public an
23679	account of the Standard Oil Company, revealing the ruthless methods of
23680	that corporation in crushing competition. About the same time Lincoln
23681	Steffens exposed the sordid character of politics in several
23682	municipalities in a series of articles bearing the painful heading: _The
23683	Shame of the Cities_. The critical spirit appeared in almost every form;
23684	in weekly and monthly magazines, in essays and pamphlets, in editorials
23685	and news stories, in novels like Churchill's _Coniston_ and Sinclair's
23686	_The Jungle_. It became so savage and so wanton that the opening years
23687	of the twentieth century were well named "the age of the muckrakers."
23688	
23689	=The Subjects of the Criticism.=--In this outburst of invective, nothing
23690	was spared. It was charged that each of the political parties had fallen
23691	into the hands of professional politicians who devoted their time to
23692	managing conventions, making platforms, nominating candidates, and
23693	dictating to officials; in return for their "services" they sold offices
23694	and privileges. It was alleged that mayors and councils had bargained
23695	away for private benefit street railway and other franchises. It was
23696	asserted that many powerful labor unions were dominated by men who
23697	blackmailed employers. Some critics specialized in descriptions of the
23698	poverty, slums, and misery of great cities. Others took up "frenzied
23699	finance" and accused financiers of selling worthless stocks and bonds to
23700	an innocent public. Still others professed to see in the accumulations
23701	of millionaires the downfall of our republic.
23702	
23703	=The Attack on "Invisible Government."=--Some even maintained that the
23704	control of public affairs had passed from the people to a sinister
23705	minority called "the invisible government." So eminent and conservative
23706	a statesman as the Hon. Elihu Root lent the weight of his great name to
23707	such an imputation. Speaking of his native state, New York, he said:
23708	"What is the government of this state? What has it been during the forty
23709	years of my acquaintance with it? The government of the Constitution?
23710	Oh, no; not half the time or half way.... From the days of Fenton and
23711	Conkling and Arthur and Cornell and Platt, from the days of David B.
23712	Hill down to the present time, the government of the state has presented
23713	two different lines of activity: one, of the constitutional and
23714	statutory officers of the state and the other of the party leaders; they
23715	call them party bosses. They call the system--I don't coin the
23716	phrase--the system they call 'invisible government.' For I don't know
23717	how many years Mr. Conkling was the supreme ruler in this state. The
23718	governor did not count, the legislature did not count, comptrollers and
23719	secretaries of state and what not did not count. It was what Mr.
23720	Conkling said, and in a great outburst of public rage he was pulled
23721	down. Then Mr. Platt ruled the state; for nigh upon twenty years he
23722	ruled it. It was not the governor; it was not the legislature; it was
23723	Mr. Platt. And the capital was not here [in Albany]; it was at 49
23724	Broadway; Mr. Platt and his lieutenants. It makes no difference what
23725	name you give, whether you call it Fenton or Conkling or Cornell or
23726	Arthur or Platt or by the names of men now living. The ruler of the
23727	state during the greater part of the forty years of my acquaintance with
23728	the state government has not been any man authorized by the constitution
23729	or by law.... The party leader is elected by no one, accountable to no
23730	one, bound by no oath of office, removable by no one."
23731	
23732	=The Nation Aroused.=--With the spirit of criticism came also the spirit
23733	of reform. The charges were usually exaggerated; often wholly false; but
23734	there was enough truth in them to warrant renewed vigilance on the part
23735	of American democracy. President Roosevelt doubtless summed up the
23736	sentiment of the great majority of citizens when he demanded the
23737	punishment of wrong-doers in 1907, saying: "It makes not a particle of
23738	difference whether these crimes are committed by a capitalist or by a
23739	laborer, by a leading banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a
23740	leading representative of a labor union. Swindling in stocks, corrupting
23741	legislatures, making fortunes by the inflation of securities, by
23742	wrecking railroads, by destroying competitors through rebates--these
23743	forms of wrong-doing in the capitalist are far more infamous than any
23744	ordinary form of embezzlement or forgery." The time had come, he added,
23745	to stop "muckraking" and proceed to the constructive work of removing
23746	the abuses that had grown up.
23747	
23748	
23749	POLITICAL REFORMS
23750	
23751	=The Public Service.=--It was a wise comprehension of the needs of
23752	American democracy that led the friends of reform to launch and to
23753	sustain for more than half a century a movement to improve the public
23754	service. On the one side they struck at the spoils system; at the right
23755	of the politicians to use public offices as mere rewards for partisan
23756	work. The federal civil service act of 1883 opened the way to reform by
23757	establishing five vital principles in law: (1) admission to office, not
23758	on the recommendation of party workers, but on the basis of competitive
23759	examinations; (2) promotion for meritorious service of the government
23760	rather than of parties; (3) no assessment of office holders for campaign
23761	funds; (4) permanent tenure during good behavior; and (5) no dismissals
23762	for political reasons. The act itself at first applied to only 14,000
23763	federal offices, but under the constant pressure from the reformers it
23764	was extended until in 1916 it covered nearly 300,000 employees out of an
23765	executive force of approximately 414,000. While gaining steadily at
23766	Washington, civil service reformers carried their agitation into the
23767	states and cities. By 1920 they were able to report ten states with
23768	civil service commissions and the merit system well intrenched in more
23769	than three hundred municipalities.
23770	
23771	In excluding spoilsmen from public office, the reformers were, in a
23772	sense, engaged in a negative work: that of "keeping the rascals out."
23773	But there was a second and larger phase to their movement, one
23774	constructive in character: that of getting skilled, loyal, and efficient
23775	servants into the places of responsibility. Everywhere on land and sea,
23776	in town and country, new burdens were laid upon public officers. They
23777	were called upon to supervise the ships sailing to and from our ports;
23778	to inspect the water and milk supplies of our cities; to construct and
23779	operate great public works, such as the Panama and Erie canals; to
23780	regulate the complicated rates of railway companies; to safeguard health
23781	and safety in a thousand ways; to climb the mountains to fight forest
23782	fires; and to descend into the deeps of the earth to combat the deadly
23783	coal gases that assail the miners. In a word, those who labored to
23784	master the secrets and the powers of nature were summoned to the aid of
23785	the government: chemists, engineers, architects, nurses, surgeons,
23786	foresters--the skilled in all the sciences, arts, and crafts.
23787	
23788	Keeping rascals out was no task at all compared with the problem of
23789	finding competent people for all the technical offices. "Now," said the
23790	reformers, "we must make attractive careers in the government work for
23791	the best American talent; we must train those applying for admission and
23792	increase the skill of those already in positions of trust; we must see
23793	to it that those entering at the bottom have a chance to rise to the
23794	top; in short, we must work for a government as skilled and efficient as
23795	it is strong, one commanding all the wisdom and talent of America that
23796	public welfare requires."
23797	
23798	=The Australian Ballot.=--A second line of attack on the political
23799	machines was made in connection with the ballot. In the early days
23800	elections were frequently held in the open air and the poll was taken by
23801	a show of hands or by the enrollment of the voters under names of their
23802	favorite candidates. When this ancient practice was abandoned in favor
23803	of the printed ballot, there was still no secrecy about elections. Each
23804	party prepared its own ballot, often of a distinctive color, containing
23805	the names of its candidates. On election day, these papers were handed
23806	out to the voters by party workers. Any one could tell from the color of
23807	the ballot dropped into the box, or from some mark on the outside of the
23808	folded ballot, just how each man voted. Those who bought votes were sure
23809	that their purchases were "delivered." Those who intimidated voters
23810	could know when their intimidation was effective. In this way the party
23811	ballot strengthened the party machine.
23812	
23813	As a remedy for such abuses, reformers, learning from the experience of
23814	Australia, urged the adoption of the "Australian ballot." That ballot,
23815	though it appeared in many forms, had certain constant features. It was
23816	official, that is, furnished by the government, not by party workers; it
23817	contained the names of all candidates of all parties; it was given out
23818	only in the polling places; and it was marked in secret. The first state
23819	to introduce it was Massachusetts. The year was 1888. Before the end of
23820	the century it had been adopted by nearly all the states in the union.
23821	The salutary effect of the reform in reducing the amount of cheating
23822	and bribery in elections was beyond all question.
23823	
23824	=The Direct Primary.=--In connection with the uprising against machine
23825	politics, came a call for the abolition of the old method of nominating
23826	candidates by conventions. These time-honored party assemblies, which
23827	had come down from the days of Andrew Jackson, were, it was said, merely
23828	conclaves of party workers, sustained by the spoils system, and
23829	dominated by an inner circle of bosses. The remedy offered in this case
23830	was again "more democracy," namely, the abolition of the party
23831	convention and the adoption of the direct primary. Candidates were no
23832	longer to be chosen by secret conferences. Any member of a party was to
23833	be allowed to run for any office, to present his name to his party by
23834	securing signatures to a petition, and to submit his candidacy to his
23835	fellow partisans at a direct primary--an election within the party. In
23836	this movement Governor La Follette of Wisconsin took the lead and his
23837	state was the first in the union to adopt the direct primary for
23838	state-wide purposes. The idea spread, rapidly in the West, more slowly
23839	in the East. The public, already angered against "the bosses," grasped
23840	eagerly at it. Governor Hughes in New York pressed it upon the unwilling
23841	legislature. State after state accepted it until by 1918 Rhode Island,
23842	Delaware, Connecticut, and New Mexico were the only states that had not
23843	bowed to the storm. Still the results were disappointing and at that
23844	very time the pendulum was beginning to swing backward.
23845	
23846	=Popular Election of Federal Senators.=--While the movement for direct
23847	primaries was still advancing everywhere, a demand for the popular
23848	election of Senators, usually associated with it, swept forward to
23849	victory. Under the original Constitution, it had been expressly provided
23850	that Senators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states. In
23851	practice this rule transferred the selection of Senators to secret
23852	caucuses of party members in the state legislatures. In connection with
23853	these caucuses there had been many scandals, some direct proofs of
23854	brazen bribery and corruption, and dark hints besides. The Senate was
23855	called by its detractors "a millionaires' club" and it was looked upon
23856	as the "citadel of conservatism." The prescription in this case was
23857	likewise "more democracy"--direct election of Senators by popular vote.
23858	
23859	This reform was not a new idea. It had been proposed in Congress as
23860	early as 1826. President Johnson, an ardent advocate, made it the
23861	subject of a special message in 1868 Not long afterward it appeared in
23862	Congress. At last in 1893, the year after the great Populist upheaval,
23863	the House of Representatives by the requisite two-thirds vote
23864	incorporated it in an amendment to the federal Constitution. Again and
23865	again it passed the House; but the Senate itself was obdurate. Able
23866	Senators leveled their batteries against it. Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts
23867	declared that it would transfer the seat of power to the "great cities
23868	and masses of population"; that it would "overthrow the whole scheme of
23869	the Senate and in the end the whole scheme of the national Constitution
23870	as designed and established by the framers of the Constitution and the
23871	people who adopted it."
23872	
23873	Failing in the Senate, advocates of popular election made a rear assault
23874	through the states. They induced state legislatures to enact laws
23875	requiring the nomination of candidates for the Senate by the direct
23876	primary, and then they bound the legislatures to abide by the popular
23877	choice. Nevada took the lead in 1899. Shortly afterward Oregon, by the
23878	use of the initiative and referendum, practically bound legislators to
23879	accept the popular nominee and the country witnessed the spectacle of a
23880	Republican legislature "electing" a Democrat to represent the state in
23881	the Senate at Washington. By 1910 three-fourths of the states had
23882	applied the direct primary in some form to the choice of Senators. Men
23883	selected by that method began to pour in upon the floors of Congress;
23884	finally in 1912 the two-thirds majority was secured for an amendment to
23885	the federal Constitution providing for the popular election of Senators.
23886	It was quickly ratified by the states. The following year it was
23887	proclaimed in effect.
23888	
23889	=The Initiative and Referendum.=--As a corrective for the evils which
23890	had grown up in state legislatures there arose a demand for the
23891	introduction of a Swiss device known as the initiative and referendum.
23892	The initiative permits any one to draw up a proposed bill; and, on
23893	securing a certain number of signatures among the voters, to require the
23894	submission of the measure to the people at an election. If the bill thus
23895	initiated receives a sufficient majority, it becomes a law. The
23896	referendum allows citizens who disapprove any act passed by the
23897	legislature to get up a petition against it and thus bring about a
23898	reference of the measure to the voters at the polls for approval or
23899	rejection. These two practices constitute a form of "direct government."
23900	
23901	These devices were prescribed "to restore the government to the people."
23902	The Populists favored them in their platform of 1896. Mr. Bryan, two
23903	years later, made them a part of his program, and in the same year South
23904	Dakota adopted them. In 1902 Oregon, after a strenuous campaign, added a
23905	direct legislation amendment to the state constitution. Within ten years
23906	all the Southwestern, Mountain, and Pacific states, except Texas and
23907	Wyoming, had followed this example. To the east of the Mississippi,
23908	however, direct legislation met a chilly reception. By 1920 only five
23909	states in this section had accepted it: Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio,
23910	Michigan, and Maryland, the last approving the referendum only.
23911	
23912	=The Recall.=--Executive officers and judges, as well as legislatures,
23913	had come in for their share of criticism, and it was proposed that they
23914	should likewise be subjected to a closer scrutiny by the public. For
23915	this purpose there was advanced a scheme known as the recall--which
23916	permitted a certain percentage of the voters to compel any officer, at
23917	any time during his term, to go before the people at a new election.
23918	This feature of direct government, tried out first in the city of Los
23919	Angeles, was extended to state-wide uses in Oregon in 1908. It failed,
23920	however, to capture popular imagination to the same degree as the
23921	initiative and referendum. At the end of ten years' agitation, only ten
23922	states, mainly in the West, had adopted it for general purposes, and
23923	four of them did not apply it to the judges of the courts. Still it was
23924	extensively acclaimed in cities and incorporated into hundreds of
23925	municipal laws and charters.
23926	
23927	As a general proposition, direct government in all its forms was
23928	bitterly opposed by men of a conservative cast of mind. It was denounced
23929	by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge as "nothing less than a complete revolution
23930	in the fabric of our government and in the fundamental principles upon
23931	which that government rests." In his opinion, it promised to break down
23932	the representative principle and "undermine and overthrow the bulwarks
23933	of ordered liberty and individual freedom." Mr. Taft shared Mr. Lodge's
23934	views and spoke of direct government with scorn. "Votes," he exclaimed,
23935	"are not bread ... referendums do not pay rent or furnish houses,
23936	recalls do not furnish clothes, initiatives do not supply employment or
23937	relieve inequalities of condition or of opportunity."
23938	
23939	=Commission Government for Cities.=--In the restless searching out of
23940	evils, the management of cities early came under critical scrutiny. City
23941	government, Mr. Bryce had remarked, was the one conspicuous failure in
23942	America. This sharp thrust, though resented by some, was accepted as a
23943	warning by others. Many prescriptions were offered by doctors of the
23944	body politic. Chief among them was the idea of simplifying the city
23945	government so that the light of public scrutiny could shine through it.
23946	"Let us elect only a few men and make them clearly responsible for the
23947	city government!" was the new cry in municipal reform. So, many city
23948	councils were reduced in size; one of the two houses, which several
23949	cities had adopted in imitation of the federal government, was
23950	abolished; and in order that the mayor could be held to account, he was
23951	given the power to appoint all the chief officials. This made the mayor,
23952	in some cases, the only elective city official and gave the voters a
23953	"short ballot" containing only a few names--an idea which some proposed
23954	to apply also to the state government.
23955	
23956	A further step in the concentration of authority was taken in Galveston,
23957	Texas, where the people, looking upon the ruin of their city wrought by
23958	the devastating storm of 1901, and confronted by the difficult problems
23959	of reconstruction, felt the necessity for a more businesslike management
23960	of city affairs and instituted a new form of local administration. They
23961	abolished the old scheme of mayor and council and vested all power in
23962	five commissioners, one of whom, without any special prerogatives, was
23963	assigned to the office of "mayor president." In 1908, the commission
23964	form of government, as it was soon characterized, was adopted by Des
23965	Moines, Iowa. The attention of all municipal reformers was drawn to it
23966	and it was hailed as the guarantee of a better day. By 1920, more than
23967	four hundred cities, including Memphis, Spokane, Birmingham, Newark, and
23968	Buffalo, had adopted it. Still the larger cities like New York and
23969	Chicago kept their boards of aldermen.
23970	
23971	=The City Manager Plan.=--A few years' experience with commission
23972	government revealed certain patent defects. The division of the work
23973	among five men was frequently found to introduce dissensions and
23974	irresponsibility. Commissioners were often lacking in the technical
23975	ability required to manage such difficult matters as fire and police
23976	protection, public health, public works, and public utilities. Some one
23977	then proposed to carry over into city government an idea from the
23978	business world. In that sphere the stockholders of each corporation
23979	elect the directors and the directors, in turn, choose a business
23980	manager to conduct the affairs of the company. It was suggested that the
23981	city commissioners, instead of attempting to supervise the details of
23982	the city administration, should select a manager to do this. The scheme
23983	was put into effect in Sumter, South Carolina, in 1912. Like the
23984	commission plan, it became popular. Within eight years more than one
23985	hundred and fifty towns and cities had adopted it. Among the larger
23986	municipalities were Dayton, Springfield (Ohio), Akron, Kalamazoo, and
23987	Phoenix. It promised to create a new public service profession, that of
23988	city manager.
23989	
23990	
23991	MEASURES OF ECONOMIC REFORM
23992	
23993	=The Spirit of American Reform.=--The purification of the ballot, the
23994	restriction of the spoils system, the enlargement of direct popular
23995	control over the organs of government were not the sole answers made by
23996	the reformers to the critics of American institutions. Nor were they the
23997	most important. In fact, they were regarded not as ends in themselves,
23998	but as means to serve a wider purpose. That purpose was the promotion of
23999	the "general welfare." The concrete objects covered by that broad term
24000	were many and varied; but they included the prevention of extortion by
24001	railway and other corporations, the protection of public health, the
24002	extension of education, the improvement of living conditions in the
24003	cities, the elimination of undeserved poverty, the removal of gross
24004	inequalities in wealth, and more equality of opportunity.
24005	
24006	All these things involved the use of the powers of government. Although
24007	a few clung to the ancient doctrine that the government should not
24008	interfere with private business at all, the American people at large
24009	rejected that theory as vigorously as they rejected the doctrines of an
24010	extreme socialism which exalts the state above the individual. Leaders
24011	representing every shade of opinion proclaimed the government an
24012	instrument of common welfare to be used in the public interest. "We must
24013	abandon definitely," said Roosevelt, "the _laissez-faire_ theory of
24014	political economy and fearlessly champion a system of increased
24015	governmental control, paying no attention to the cries of worthy people
24016	who denounce this as socialistic." This view was shared by Mr. Taft, who
24017	observed: "Undoubtedly the government can wisely do much more ... to
24018	relieve the oppressed, to create greater equality of opportunity, to
24019	make reasonable terms for labor in employment, and to furnish vocational
24020	education." He was quick to add his caution that "there is a line beyond
24021	which the government cannot go with any good practical results in
24022	seeking to make men and society better."
24023	
24024	=The Regulation of Railways.=--The first attempts to use the government
24025	in a large way to control private enterprise in the public interest were
24026	made by the Northwestern states in the decade between 1870 and 1880.
24027	Charges were advanced by the farmers, particularly those organized into
24028	Granges, that the railways extorted the highest possible rates for
24029	freight and passengers, that favoritism was shown to large shippers,
24030	that fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to the innocent public. It
24031	was claimed that railways were not like other enterprises, but were
24032	"quasi-public" concerns, like the roads and ferries, and thus subject to
24033	government control. Accordingly laws were enacted bringing the railroads
24034	under state supervision. In some cases the state legislature fixed the
24035	maximum rates to be charged by common carriers, and in other cases
24036	commissions were created with the power to establish the rates after an
24037	investigation. This legislation was at first denounced in the East as
24038	nothing less than the "confiscation" of the railways in the interest of
24039	the farmers. Attempts to have the Supreme Court of the United States
24040	declare it unconstitutional were made without avail; still a principle
24041	was finally laid down to the effect that in fixing rates state
24042	legislatures and commissions must permit railway companies to earn a
24043	"fair" return on the capital invested.
24044	
24045	In a few years the Granger spirit appeared in Congress. An investigation
24046	revealed a long list of abuses committed by the railways against
24047	shippers and travelers. The result was the interstate commerce act of
24048	1887, which created the Interstate Commerce Commission, forbade
24049	discriminations in rates, and prohibited other objectionable practices
24050	on the part of railways. This measure was loosely enforced and the
24051	abuses against which it was directed continued almost unabated. A demand
24052	for stricter control grew louder and louder. Congress was forced to
24053	heed. In 1903 it enacted the Elkins law, forbidding railways to charge
24054	rates other than those published, and laid penalties upon the officers
24055	and agents of companies, who granted secret favors to shippers, and upon
24056	shippers who accepted them. Three years later a still more drastic step
24057	was taken by the passage of the Hepburn act. The Interstate Commerce
24058	Commission was authorized, upon complaint of some party aggrieved, and
24059	after a public hearing, to determine whether just and reasonable rates
24060	had been charged by the companies. In effect, the right to fix freight
24061	and passenger rates was taken out of the hands of the owners of the
24062	railways engaged in interstate commerce and vested in the hands of the
24063	Interstate Commerce Commission. Thus private property to the value of
24064	$20,000,000,000 or more was declared to be a matter of public concern
24065	and subject to government regulation in the common interest.
24066	
24067	=Municipal Utilities.=--Similar problems arose in connection with the
24068	street railways, electric light plants, and other utilities in the great
24069	cities. In the beginning the right to construct such undertakings was
24070	freely, and often corruptly, granted to private companies by city
24071	councils. Distressing abuses arose in connection with such practices.
24072	Many grants or franchises were made perpetual, or perhaps for a term of
24073	999 years. The rates charged and services rendered were left largely to
24074	the will of the companies holding the franchises. Mergers or unions of
24075	companies were common and the public was deluged with stocks and bonds
24076	of doubtful value; bankruptcies were frequent. The connection between
24077	the utility companies and the politicians was, to say the least, not
24078	always in the public interest.
24079	
24080	American ingenuity was quick to devise methods for eliminating such
24081	evils. Three lines of progress were laid out by the reformers. One group
24082	proposed that such utilities should be subject to municipal or state
24083	regulation, that the formation of utility companies should be under
24084	public control, and that the issue of stocks and bonds must be approved
24085	by public authority. In some cases state, and in other cases municipal,
24086	commissions were created to exercise this great power over "quasi-public
24087	corporations." Wisconsin, by laws enacted in 1907, put all heat, light,
24088	water works, telephone, and street railway companies under the
24089	supervision of a single railway commission. Other states followed this
24090	example rapidly. By 1920 the principle of public control over municipal
24091	utilities was accepted in nearly every section of the union.
24092	
24093	A second line of reform appeared in the "model franchise" for utility
24094	corporations. An illustration of this tendency was afforded by the
24095	Chicago street railway settlement of 1906. The total capital of the
24096	company was fixed at a definite sum, its earnings were agreed upon, and
24097	the city was given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired
24098	to do so. In many states, about the same time, it was provided that no
24099	franchises to utility companies could run more than twenty-five years.
24100	
24101	A third group of reformers were satisfied with nothing short of
24102	municipal ownership. They proposed to drive private companies entirely
24103	out of the field and vest the ownership and management of municipal
24104	plants in the city itself. This idea was extensively applied to electric
24105	light and water works plants, but to street railways in only a few
24106	cities, including San Francisco and Seattle. In New York the subways are
24107	owned by the city but leased for operation.
24108	
24109	=Tenement House Control.=--Among the other pressing problems of the
24110	cities was the overcrowding in houses unfit for habitation. An inquiry
24111	in New York City made under the authority of the state in 1902 revealed
24112	poverty, misery, slums, dirt, and disease almost beyond imagination. The
24113	immediate answer was the enactment of a tenement house law prescribing
24114	in great detail the size of the rooms, the air space, the light and the
24115	sanitary arrangement for all new buildings. An immense improvement
24116	followed and the idea was quickly taken up in other states having large
24117	industrial centers. In 1920 New York made a further invasion of the
24118	rights of landlords by assuring to the public "reasonable rents" for
24119	flats and apartments.
24120	
24121	=Workmen's Compensation.=--No small part of the poverty in cities was
24122	due to the injury of wage-earners while at their trade. Every year the
24123	number of men and women killed or wounded in industry mounted higher.
24124	Under the old law, the workman or his family had to bear the loss unless
24125	the employer had been guilty of some extraordinary negligence. Even in
24126	that case an expensive lawsuit was usually necessary to recover
24127	"damages." In short, although employers insured their buildings and
24128	machinery against necessary risks from fire and storm, they allowed
24129	their employees to assume the heavy losses due to accidents. The
24130	injustice of this, though apparent enough now, was once not generally
24131	recognized. It was said to be unfair to make the employer pay for
24132	injuries for which he was not personally responsible; but the argument
24133	was overborne.
24134	
24135	[Illustration: AN EAST SIDE STREET IN NEW YORK]
24136	
24137	About 1910 there set in a decided movement in the direction of lifting
24138	the burden of accidents from the unfortunate victims. In the first
24139	place, laws were enacted requiring employers to pay damages in certain
24140	amounts according to the nature of the case, no matter how the accident
24141	occurred, as long as the injured person was not guilty of willful
24142	negligence. By 1914 more than one-half the states had such laws. In the
24143	second place, there developed schemes of industrial insurance in the
24144	form of automatic grants made by state commissions to persons injured in
24145	industries, the funds to be provided by the employers or the state or by
24146	both. By 1917 thirty-six states had legislation of this type.
24147	
24148	=Minimum Wages and Mothers' Pensions.=--Another source of poverty,
24149	especially among women and children, was found to be the low wages paid
24150	for their labor. Report after report showed this. In 1912 Massachusetts
24151	took a significant step in the direction of declaring the minimum wages
24152	which might be paid to women and children. Oregon, the following year,
24153	created a commission with power to prescribe minimum wages in certain
24154	industries, based on the cost of living, and to enforce the rates fixed.
24155	Within a short time one-third of the states had legislation of this
24156	character. To cut away some of the evils of poverty and enable widows to
24157	keep their homes intact and bring up their children, a device known as
24158	mothers' pensions became popular during the second decade of the
24159	twentieth century. At the opening of 1913 two states, Colorado and
24160	Illinois, had laws authorizing the payment from public funds of definite
24161	sums to widows with children. Within four years, thirty-five states had
24162	similar legislation.
24163	
24164	=Taxation and Great Fortunes.=--As a part of the campaign waged against
24165	poverty by reformers there came a demand for heavy taxes upon great
24166	fortunes, particularly taxes upon inheritances or estates passing to
24167	heirs on the decease of the owners. Roosevelt was an ardent champion of
24168	this type of taxation and dwelt upon it at length in his message to
24169	Congress in 1907. "Such a tax," he said, "would help to preserve a
24170	measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations
24171	growing to manhood.... Our aim is to recognize what Lincoln pointed out:
24172	the fact that there are some respects in which men are obviously not
24173	equal; but also to insist that there should be equality of self-respect
24174	and of mutual respect, an equality of rights before the law, and at
24175	least an approximate equality in the conditions under which each man
24176	obtains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with
24177	his fellows."
24178	
24179	The spirit of the new age was, therefore, one of reform, not of
24180	revolution. It called for no evolutionary or utopian experiments, but
24181	for the steady and progressive enactment of measures aimed at admitted
24182	abuses and designed to accomplish tangible results in the name of public
24183	welfare.

24272	THE NEW POLITICAL DEMOCRACY
24273	
24274	
24275	=Women in Public Affairs.=--The social legislation enacted in response
24276	to the spirit of reform vitally affected women in the home and in
24277	industry and was promoted by their organizations. Where they did not
24278	lead, they were affiliated with movements for social improvement. No
24279	cause escaped their attention; no year passed without widening the range
24280	of their interests. They served on committees that inquired into the
24281	problems of the day; they appeared before legislative assemblies to
24282	advocate remedies for the evils they discovered. By 1912 they were a
24283	force to be reckoned with in national politics. In nine states complete
24284	and equal suffrage had been established, and a widespread campaign for a
24285	national suffrage amendment was in full swing. On every hand lay
24286	evidences that their sphere had been broadened to include public
24287	affairs. This was the culmination of forces that had long been
24288	operating.
24289	
24290	=A New Emphasis in History.=--A movement so deeply affecting important
24291	interests could not fail to find a place in time in the written record
24292	of human progress. History often began as a chronicle of kings and
24293	queens, knights and ladies, written partly to amuse and partly to
24294	instruct the classes that appeared in its pages. With the growth of
24295	commerce, parliaments, and international relations, politics and
24296	diplomacy were added to such chronicles of royal and princely doings.
24297	After the rise of democracy, industry, and organized labor, the
24298	transactions of everyday life were deemed worthy of a place in the pages
24299	of history. In each case history was rewritten and the past rediscovered
24300	in the light of the new age. So it will be with the rise and growth of
24301	women's political power. The history of their labor, their education,
24302	their status in society, their influence on the course of events will be
24303	explored and given its place in the general record.
24304	
24305	It will be a history of change. The superior position which women enjoy
24306	in America to-day is the result of a slow evolution from an almost
24307	rightless condition in colonial times. The founders of America brought
24308	with them the English common law. Under that law, a married woman's
24309	personal property--jewels, money, furniture, and the like--became her
24310	husband's property; the management of her lands passed into his control.
24311	Even the wages she earned, if she worked for some one else, belonged to
24312	him. Custom, if not law, prescribed that women should not take part in
24313	town meetings or enter into public discussions of religious questions.
24314	Indeed it is a far cry from the banishment of Anne Hutchinson from
24315	Massachusetts in 1637, for daring to dispute with the church fathers, to
24316	the political conventions of 1920 in which women sat as delegates, made
24317	nominating speeches, and served on committees. In the contrast between
24318	these two scenes may be measured the change in the privileges of women
24319	since the landing of the Pilgrims. The account of this progress is a
24320	narrative of individual effort on the part of women, of organizations
24321	among them, of generous aid from sympathetic men in the long agitation
24322	for the removal of civil and political disabilities. It is in part also
24323	a narrative of irresistible economic change which drew women into
24324	industry, created a leisure class, gave women wages and incomes, and
24325	therewith economic independence.
24326	
24327	
24328	THE RISE OF THE WOMAN MOVEMENT
24329	
24330	=Protests of Colonial Women.=--The republican spirit which produced
24331	American independence was of slow and steady growth. It did not spring
24332	up full-armed in a single night. It was, on the contrary, nourished
24333	during a long period of time by fireside discussions as well as by
24334	debates in the public forum. Women shared that fireside sifting of
24335	political principles and passed on the findings of that scrutiny in
24336	letters to their friends, newspaper articles, and every form of written
24337	word. How widespread was this potent, though not spectacular force, is
24338	revealed in the collections of women's letters, articles, songs, dramas,
24339	and satirical "skits" on English rule that have come down to us. In this
24340	search into the reasons of government, some women began to take thought
24341	about laws that excluded them from the ballot. Two women at least left
24342	their protests on record. Abigail, the ingenious and witty wife of John
24343	Adams, wrote to her husband, in March, 1776, that women objected "to all
24344	arbitrary power whether of state or males" and demanded political
24345	privileges in the new order then being created. Hannah Lee Corbin, the
24346	sister of "Lighthorse" Harry Lee, protested to her brother against the
24347	taxation of women without representation.
24348	
24349	[Illustration: ABIGAIL ADAMS]
24350	
24351	=The Stir among European Women.=--Ferment in America, in the case of
24352	women as of men, was quickened by events in Europe. In 1792, Mary
24353	Wollstonecraft published in England the _Vindication of the Rights of
24354	Women_--a book that was destined to serve the cause of liberty among
24355	women as the writings of Locke and Paine had served that of men. The
24356	specific grievances which stirred English women were men's invasion of
24357	women's industries, such as spinning and weaving; the denial of equal
24358	educational opportunities; and political disabilities. In France also
24359	the great Revolution raised questionings about the status of women. The
24360	rights of "citizenesses" as well as the rights of "citizens" were
24361	examined by the boldest thinkers. This in turn reacted upon women in the
24362	United States.
24363	
24364	=Leadership in America.=--The origins of the American woman movement are
24365	to be found in the writings of a few early intellectual leaders. During
24366	the first decades of the nineteenth century, books, articles, and
24367	pamphlets about women came in increasing numbers from the press. Lydia
24368	Maria Child wrote a history of women; Margaret Fuller made a critical
24369	examination of the status of women in her time; and Mrs. Elizabeth Ellet
24370	supplemented the older histories by showing what an important part women
24371	had played in the American Revolution.
24372	
24373	=The Struggle for Education.=--Along with criticism, there was carried
24374	on a constructive struggle for better educational facilities for women
24375	who had been from the beginning excluded from every college in the
24376	country. In this long battle, Emma Willard and Mary Lyon led the way;
24377	the former founded a seminary at Troy, New York; and the latter made the
24378	beginnings of Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Oberlin College in
24379	Ohio, established in 1833, opened its doors to girls and from it were
24380	graduated young students to lead in the woman movement. Sarah J. Hale,
24381	who in 1827 became the editor of a "Ladies' Magazine," published in
24382	Boston, conducted a campaign for equal educational opportunities which
24383	helped to bear fruit in the founding of Vassar College shortly after the
24384	Civil War.
24385	
24386	=The Desire to Effect Reforms.=--As they came to study their own history
24387	and their own part in civilization, women naturally became deeply
24388	interested in all the controversies going on around them. The temperance
24389	question made a special appeal to them and they organized to demand the
24390	right to be heard on it. In 1846 the "Daughters of Temperance" formed a
24391	secret society favoring prohibition. They dared to criticize the
24392	churches for their indifference and were so bold as to ask that
24393	drunkenness be made a ground for divorce.
24394	
24395	The slavery issue even more than temperance called women into public
24396	life. The Grimke sisters of South Carolina emancipated their bondmen,
24397	and one of these sisters, exiled from Charleston for her "Appeal to the
24398	Christian Women of the South," went North to work against the slavery
24399	system. In 1837 the National Women's Anti-Slavery Convention met in New
24400	York; seventy-one women delegates represented eight states. Three years
24401	later eight American women, five of them in Quaker costume, attended the
24402	World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, much to the horror of the men,
24403	who promptly excluded them from the sessions on the ground that it was
24404	not fitting for women to take part in such meetings.
24405	
24406	In other spheres of activity, especially social service, women steadily
24407	enlarged their interest. Nothing human did they consider alien to them.
24408	They inveighed against cruel criminal laws and unsanitary prisons. They
24409	organized poor relief and led in private philanthropy. Dorothea Dix
24410	directed the movement that induced the New York legislature to establish
24411	in 1845 a separate asylum for the criminal insane. In the same year
24412	Sarah G. Bagley organized the Lowell Female Reform Association for the
24413	purpose of reducing the long hours of labor for women, safeguarding "the
24414	constitutions of future generations." Mrs. Eliza Woodson Farnham, matron
24415	in Sing Sing penitentiary, was known throughout the nation for her
24416	social work, especially prison reform. Wherever there were misery and
24417	suffering, women were preparing programs of relief.
24418	
24419	=Freedom of Speech for Women.=--In the advancement of their causes, of
24420	whatever kind, women of necessity had to make public appeals and take
24421	part in open meetings. Here they encountered difficulties. The
24422	appearance of women on the platform was new and strange. Naturally it
24423	was widely resented. Antoinette Brown, although she had credentials as a
24424	delegate, was driven off the platform of a temperance convention in New
24425	York City simply because she was a woman. James Russell Lowell, editor
24426	of the "Atlantic Monthly," declined a poem from Julia Ward Howe on the
24427	theory that no woman could write a poem; but he added on second thought
24428	that he might consider an article in prose. Nathaniel Hawthorne,
24429	another editor, even objected to something in prose because to him "all
24430	ink-stained women were equally detestable." To the natural resentment
24431	against their intrusion into new fields was added that aroused by their
24432	ideas and methods. As temperance reformers, they criticized in a caustic
24433	manner those who would not accept their opinions. As opponents of
24434	slavery they were especially bitter. One of their conventions, held at
24435	Philadelphia in 1833, passed a resolution calling on all women to leave
24436	those churches that would not condemn every form of human bondage. This
24437	stirred against them many of the clergy who, accustomed to having women
24438	sit silent during services, were in no mood to treat such a revolt
24439	leniently. Then came the last straw. Women decided that they would
24440	preach--out of the pulpit first, and finally in it.
24441	
24442	=Women in Industry.=--The period of this ferment was also the age of the
24443	industrial revolution in America, the rise of the factory system, and
24444	the growth of mill towns. The labor of women was transferred from the
24445	homes to the factories. Then arose many questions: the hours of labor,
24446	the sanitary conditions of the mills, the pressure of foreign
24447	immigration on native labor, the wages of women as compared with those
24448	of men, and the right of married women to their own earnings. Labor
24449	organizations sprang up among working women. The mill girls of Lowell,
24450	Massachusetts, mainly the daughters of New England farmers, published a
24451	magazine, "The Lowell Offering." So excellent were their writings that
24452	the French statesman, Thiers, carried a copy of their paper into the
24453	Chamber of Deputies to show what working women could achieve in a
24454	republic. As women were now admittedly earning their own way in the
24455	world by their own labor, they began to talk of their "economic
24456	independence."
24457	
24458	=The World Shaken by Revolution.=--Such was the quickening of women's
24459	minds in 1848 when the world was startled once more by a revolution in
24460	France which spread to Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, and Italy.
24461	Once more the people of the earth began to explore the principles of
24462	democracy and expound human rights. Women, now better educated and more
24463	"advanced" in their ideas, played a role of still greater importance in
24464	that revolution. They led in agitations and uprisings. They suffered
24465	from reaction and persecution. From their prison in France, two of them
24466	who had been jailed for too much insistence on women's rights exchanged
24467	greetings with American women who were raising the same issue here. By
24468	this time the women had more supporters among the men. Horace Greeley,
24469	editor of the New York _Tribune_, though he afterwards recanted, used
24470	his powerful pen in their behalf. Anti-slavery leaders welcomed their
24471	aid and repaid them by urging the enfranchisement of women.
24472	
24473	=The Woman's Rights Convention of 1848.=--The forces, moral and
24474	intellectual, which had been stirring among women, crystallized a few
24475	months after the outbreak of the European revolution in the first
24476	Woman's Rights Convention in the history of America. It met at Seneca
24477	Falls, New York, in 1848, on the call of Lucretia Mott, Martha Wright,
24478	Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mary Ann McClintock, three of them Quakers.
24479	Accustomed to take part in church meetings with men, the Quakers
24480	naturally suggested that men as well as women be invited to attend the
24481	convention. Indeed, a man presided over the conference, for that
24482	position seemed too presumptuous even for such stout advocates of
24483	woman's rights.
24484	
24485	The deliberations of the Seneca Falls convention resulted in a
24486	Declaration of Rights modeled after the Declaration of Independence. For
24487	example, the preamble began: "When in the course of human events it
24488	becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among
24489	the people of the earth a position different from that which they have
24490	hitherto occupied...." So also it closed: "Such has been the patient
24491	suffering of women under this government and such is now the necessity
24492	which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are
24493	entitled." Then followed the list of grievances, the same number which
24494	had been exhibited to George III in 1776. Especially did they assail the
24495	disabilities imposed upon them by the English common law imported into
24496	America--the law which denied married women their property, their wages,
24497	and their legal existence as separate persons. All these grievances they
24498	recited to "a candid world." The remedies for the evils which they
24499	endured were then set forth in detail. They demanded "equal rights" in
24500	the colleges, trades, and professions; equal suffrage; the right to
24501	share in all political offices, honors, and emoluments; the right to
24502	complete equality in marriage, including equal guardianship of the
24503	children; and for married women the right to own property, to keep
24504	wages, to make contracts, to transact business, and to testify in the
24505	courts of justice. In short, they declared women to be persons as men
24506	are persons and entitled to all the rights and privileges of human
24507	beings. Such was the clarion call which went forth to the world in
24508	1848--to an amused and contemptuous world, it must be admitted--but to a
24509	world fated to heed and obey.
24510	
24511	=The First Gains in Civil Liberty.=--The convention of 1848 did not make
24512	political enfranchisement the leading issue. Rather did it emphasize the
24513	civil disabilities of women which were most seriously under discussion
24514	at the time. Indeed, the New York legislature of that very year, as the
24515	result of a twelve years' agitation, passed the Married Woman's Property
24516	Act setting aside the general principles of the English common law as
24517	applied to women and giving them many of the "rights of man." California
24518	and Wisconsin followed in 1850; Massachusetts in 1854; and Kansas in
24519	1859. Other states soon fell into line. Women's earnings and
24520	inheritances were at last their own in some states at least. In a little
24521	while laws were passed granting women rights as equal guardians of their
24522	children and permitting them to divorce their husbands on the grounds of
24523	cruelty and drunkenness.
24524	
24525	By degrees other steps were taken. The Woman's Medical College of
24526	Pennsylvania was founded in 1850, and the Philadelphia School of Design
24527	for Women three years later. In 1852 the American Women's Educational
24528	Association was formed to initiate an agitation for enlarged
24529	educational opportunities for women. Other colleges soon emulated the
24530	example of Oberlin: the University of Utah in 1850; Hillsdale College in
24531	Michigan in 1855; Baker University in Kansas in 1858; and the University
24532	of Iowa in 1860. New trades and professions were opened to women and old
24533	prejudices against their activities and demands slowly gave way.
24534	
24535	
24536	THE NATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE
24537	
24538	=The Beginnings of Organization.=--As women surmounted one obstacle
24539	after another, the agitation for equal suffrage came to the front. If
24540	any year is to be fixed as the date of its beginning, it may very well
24541	be 1850, when the suffragists of Ohio urged the state constitutional
24542	convention to confer the vote upon them. With apparent spontaneity there
24543	were held in the same year state suffrage conferences in Indiana,
24544	Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts; and connections were formed among the
24545	leaders of these meetings. At the same time the first national suffrage
24546	convention was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, on the call of
24547	eighty-nine leading men and women representing six states. Accounts of
24548	the convention were widely circulated in this country and abroad.
24549	English women,--for instance, Harriet Martineau,--sent words of
24550	appreciation for the work thus inaugurated. It inspired a leading
24551	article in the "Westminster Review," which deeply interested the
24552	distinguished economist, John Stuart Mill. Soon he was the champion of
24553	woman suffrage in the British Parliament and the author of a powerful
24554	tract _The Subjection of Women_, widely read throughout the
24555	English-speaking world. Thus do world movements grow. Strange to relate
24556	the women of England were enfranchised before the adoption of the
24557	federal suffrage amendment in America.
24558	
24559	The national suffrage convention of 1850 was followed by an
24560	extraordinary outburst of agitation. Pamphlets streamed from the press.
24561	Petitions to legislative bodies were drafted, signed, and presented.
24562	There were addresses by favorite orators like Garrison, Phillips, and
24563	Curtis, and lectures and poems by men like Emerson, Longfellow, and
24564	Whittier. In 1853 the first suffrage paper was founded by the wife of a
24565	member of Congress from Rhode Island. By this time the last barrier to
24566	white manhood suffrage in the North had been swept away and the woman's
24567	movement was gaining momentum every year.
24568	
24569	=The Suffrage Movement Checked by the Civil War.=--Advocates of woman
24570	suffrage believed themselves on the high road to success when the Civil
24571	War engaged the energies and labors of the nation. Northern women became
24572	absorbed in the struggle to preserve the union. They held no suffrage
24573	conventions for five years. They transformed their associations into
24574	Loyalty Leagues. They banded together to buy only domestic goods when
24575	foreign imports threatened to ruin American markets. They rolled up
24576	monster petitions in favor of the emancipation of slaves. In hospitals,
24577	in military prisons, in agriculture, and in industry they bore their
24578	full share of responsibility. Even when the New York legislature took
24579	advantage of their unguarded moments and repealed the law giving the
24580	mother equal rights with the father in the guardianship of children,
24581	they refused to lay aside war work for agitation. As in all other wars,
24582	their devotion was unstinted and their sacrifices equal to the
24583	necessities of the hour.
24584	
24585	=The Federal Suffrage Amendment.=--Their plans and activities, when the
24586	war closed, were shaped by events beyond their control. The emancipation
24587	of the slaves and their proposed enfranchisement made prominent the
24588	question of a national suffrage for the first time in our history.
24589	Friends of the colored man insisted that his civil liberties would not
24590	be safe unless he was granted the right to vote. The woman suffragists
24591	very pertinently asked why the same principle did not apply to women.
24592	The answer which they received was negative. The fourteenth amendment to
24593	the federal Constitution, adopted in 1868, definitely put women aside by
24594	limiting the scope of its application, so far as the suffrage was
24595	concerned, to the male sex. In making manhood suffrage national,
24596	however, it nationalized the issue.
24597	
24598	This was the signal for the advocates of woman suffrage. In March, 1869,
24599	their proposed amendment was introduced in Congress by George W. Julian
24600	of Indiana. It provided that no citizen should be deprived of the vote
24601	on account of sex, following the language of the fifteenth amendment
24602	which forbade disfranchisement on account of race. Support for the
24603	amendment, coming from many directions, led the suffragists to believe
24604	that their case was hopeful. In their platform of 1872, for example, the
24605	Republicans praised the women for their loyal devotion to freedom,
24606	welcomed them to spheres of wider usefulness, and declared that the
24607	demand of any class of citizens for additional rights deserved
24608	"respectful consideration."
24609

24612	SUSAN B. ANTHONY]
24613	
24614	Experience soon demonstrated, however, that praise was not the ballot.
24615	Indeed the suffragists already had realized that a tedious contest lay
24616	before them. They had revived in 1866 their regular national convention.
24617	They gave the name of "The Revolution" to their paper, edited by
24618	Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. They formed a national
24619	suffrage association and organized annual pilgrimages to Congress to
24620	present their claims. Such activities bore some results. Many eminent
24621	congressmen were converted to their cause and presented it ably to their
24622	colleagues of both chambers. Still the subject was ridiculed by the
24623	newspapers and looked upon as freakish by the masses.
24624	
24625	=The State Campaigns.=--Discouraged by the outcome of the national
24626	campaign, suffragists turned to the voters of the individual states and
24627	sought the ballot at their hands. Gains by this process were painfully
24628	slow. Wyoming, it is true, while still a territory, granted suffrage to
24629	women in 1869 and continued it on becoming a state twenty years later,
24630	in spite of strong protests in Congress. In 1893 Colorado established
24631	complete political equality. In Utah, the third suffrage state, the
24632	cause suffered many vicissitudes. Women were enfranchised by the
24633	territorial legislature; they were deprived of the ballot by Congress in
24634	1887; finally in 1896 on the admission of Utah to the union they
24635	recovered their former rights. During the same year, 1896, Idaho
24636	conferred equal suffrage upon the women. This was the last suffrage
24637	victory for more than a decade.
24638	
24639	=The Suffrage Cause in Congress.=--In the midst of the meager gains
24640	among the states there were occasional flurries of hope for immediate
24641	action on the federal amendment. Between 1878 and 1896 the Senate
24642	committee reported the suffrage resolution by a favorable majority on
24643	five different occasions. During the same period, however, there were
24644	nine unfavorable reports and only once did the subject reach the point
24645	of a general debate. At no time could anything like the required
24646	two-thirds vote be obtained.
24647	
24648	=The Changing Status of Women.=--While the suffrage movement was
24649	lagging, the activities of women in other directions were steadily
24650	multiplying. College after college--Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Smith, Wellesley,
24651	to mention a few--was founded to give them the advantages of higher
24652	education. Other institutions, especially the state universities of the
24653	West, opened their doors to women, and women were received into the
24654	professions of law and medicine. By the rapid growth of public high
24655	schools in which girls enjoyed the same rights as boys, education was
24656	extended still more widely. The number of women teachers increased by
24657	leaps and bounds.
24658	
24659	Meanwhile women were entering nearly every branch of industry and
24660	business. How many of them worked at gainful occupations before 1870 we
24661	do not know; but from that year forward we have the records of the
24662	census. Between 1870 and 1900 the proportion of women in the professions
24663	rose from less than two per cent to more than ten per cent; in trade and
24664	transportation from 24.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent; and in manufacturing
24665	from 13 to 19 per cent. In 1910, there were over 8,000,000 women
24666	gainfully employed as compared with 30,000,000 men. When, during the war
24667	on Germany, the government established the principle of equal pay for
24668	equal work and gave official recognition to the value of their services
24669	in industry, it was discovered how far women had traveled along the road
24670	forecast by the leaders of 1848.
24671	
24672	=The Club Movement among Women.=--All over the country women's societies
24673	and clubs were started to advance this or that reform or merely to study
24674	literature, art, and science. In time these women's organizations of all
24675	kinds were federated into city, state, and national associations and
24676	drawn into the consideration of public questions. Under the leadership
24677	of Frances Willard they made temperance reform a vital issue. They took
24678	an interest in legislation pertaining to prisons, pure food, public
24679	health, and municipal government, among other things. At their sessions
24680	and conferences local, state, and national issues were discussed until
24681	finally, it seems, everything led to the quest of the franchise. By
24682	solemn resolution in 1914 the National Federation of Women's Clubs,
24683	representing nearly two million club women, formally endorsed woman
24684	suffrage. In the same year the National Education Association, speaking
24685	for the public school teachers of the land, added its seal of approval.
24686	
24687	=State and National Action.=--Again the suffrage movement was in full
24688	swing in the states. Washington in 1910, California in 1911, Oregon,
24689	Kansas, and Arizona in 1912, Nevada and Montana in 1914 by popular vote
24690	enfranchised their women. Illinois in 1913 conferred upon them the right
24691	to vote for President of the United States. The time had arrived for a
24692	new movement. A number of younger suffragists sought to use the votes of
24693	women in the equal suffrage states to compel one or both of the national
24694	political parties to endorse and carry through Congress the federal
24695	suffrage amendment. Pressure then came upon Congress from every
24696	direction: from the suffragists who made a straight appeal on the
24697	grounds of justice; and from the suffragists who besought the women of
24698	the West to vote against candidates for President, who would not approve
24699	the federal amendment. In 1916, for the first time, a leading
24700	presidential candidate, Mr. Charles E. Hughes, speaking for the
24701	Republicans, endorsed the federal amendment and a distinguished
24702	ex-President, Roosevelt, exerted a powerful influence to keep it an
24703	issue in the campaign.

24707	CONFERENCE OF MEN AND WOMEN DELEGATES AT A NATIONAL CONVENTION IN
24708	1920]
24709	
24710	=National Enfranchisement.=--After that, events moved rapidly. The great
24711	state of New York adopted equal suffrage in 1917. Oklahoma, South
24712	Dakota, and Michigan swung into line the following year; several other
24713	states, by legislative action, gave women the right to vote for
24714	President. In the meantime the suffrage battle at Washington grew
24715	intense. Appeals and petitions poured in upon Congress and the
24716	President. Militant suffragists held daily demonstrations in Washington.
24717	On September 30, 1918, President Wilson, who, two years before, had
24718	opposed federal action and endorsed suffrage by state adoption only,
24719	went before Congress and urged the passage of the suffrage amendment to
24720	the Constitution. In June, 1919, the requisite two-thirds vote was
24721	secured; the resolution was carried and transmitted to the states for
24722	ratification. On August 28, 1920, the thirty-sixth state, Tennessee,
24723	approved the amendment, making three-fourths of the states as required
24724	by the Constitution. Thus woman suffrage became the law of the land. A
24725	new political democracy had been created. The age of agitation was
24726	closed and the epoch of responsible citizenship opened.

24806	INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
24807	
24808	
24809	=The New Economic Age.=--The spirit of criticism and the measures of
24810	reform designed to meet it, which characterized the opening years of the
24811	twentieth century, were merely the signs of a new age. The nation had
24812	definitely passed into industrialism. The number of city dwellers
24813	employed for wages as contrasted with the farmers working on their own
24814	land was steadily mounting. The free land, once the refuge of restless
24815	workingmen of the East and the immigrants from Europe, was a thing of
24816	the past. As President Roosevelt later said in speaking of the great
24817	coal strike, "a few generations ago, the American workman could have
24818	saved money, gone West, and taken up a homestead. Now the free lands
24819	were gone. In earlier days, a man who began with a pick and shovel might
24820	come to own a mine. That outlet was now closed as regards the immense
24821	majority.... The majority of men who earned wages in the coal industry,
24822	if they wished to progress at all, were compelled to progress not by
24823	ceasing to be wage-earners but by improving the conditions under which
24824	all the wage-earners of the country lived and worked."
24825	
24826	The disappearance of the free land, President Roosevelt went on to say,
24827	also produced "a crass inequality in the bargaining relation of the
24828	employer and the individual employee standing alone. The great
24829	coal-mining and coal-carrying companies which employed their tens of
24830	thousands could easily dispense with the services of any particular
24831	miner. The miner, on the other hand, however expert, could not dispense
24832	with the companies. He needed a job; his wife and children would starve
24833	if he did not get one.... Individually the miners were impotent when
24834	they sought to enter a wage contract with the great companies; they
24835	could make fair terms only by uniting into trade unions to bargain
24836	collectively." It was of this state of affairs that President Taft spoke
24837	when he favored the modification of the common law "so as to put
24838	employees of little power and means on a level with their employers in
24839	adjusting and agreeing upon their mutual obligations."
24840	
24841	John D. Rockefeller, Jr., on the side of the great captains of industry,
24842	recognized the same facts. He said: "In the early days of the
24843	development of industry, the employer and capital investor were
24844	frequently one. Daily contact was had between him and his employees, who
24845	were his friends and neighbors.... Because of the proportions which
24846	modern industry has attained, employers and employees are too often
24847	strangers to each other.... Personal relations can be revived only
24848	through adequate representation of the employees. Representation is a
24849	principle which is fundamentally just and vital to the successful
24850	conduct of industry.... It is not consistent for us as Americans to
24851	demand democracy in government and practice autocracy in industry....
24852	With the developments what they are in industry to-day, there is sure to
24853	come a progressive evolution from aristocratic single control, whether
24854	by capital, labor, or the state, to democratic, cooperative control by
24855	all three."
24856	
24857	
24858	COOPERATION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES
24859	
24860	=Company Unions.=--The changed economic life described by the three
24861	eminent men just quoted was acknowledged by several great companies and
24862	business concerns. All over the country decided efforts were made to
24863	bridge the gulf which industry and the corporation had created. Among
24864	the devices adopted was that of the "company union." In one of the
24865	Western lumber mills, for example, all the employees were invited to
24866	join a company organization; they held monthly meetings to discuss
24867	matters of common concern; they elected a "shop committee" to confer
24868	with the representatives of the company; and periodically the agents of
24869	the employers attended the conferences of the men to talk over matters
24870	of mutual interest. The function of the shop committee was to consider
24871	wages, hours, safety rules, sanitation, recreation and other problems.
24872	Whenever any employee had a grievance he took it up with the foreman
24873	and, if it was not settled to his satisfaction, he brought it before the
24874	shop committee. If the members of the shop committee decided in favor of
24875	the man with a grievance, they attempted to settle the matter with the
24876	company's agents. All these things failing, the dispute was transferred
24877	to a grand meeting of all the employees with the employers'
24878	representatives, in common council. A deadlock, if it ensued from such a
24879	conference, was broken by calling in impartial arbitrators selected by
24880	both sides from among citizens outside the mill. Thus the employees were
24881	given a voice in all decisions affecting their work and welfare; rights
24882	and grievances were treated as matters of mutual interest rather than
24883	individual concern. Representatives of trade unions from outside,
24884	however, were rigidly excluded from all negotiations between employers
24885	and the employees.
24886	
24887	=Profit-sharing.=--Another proposal for drawing capital and labor
24888	together was to supplement the wage system by other ties. Sometimes lump
24889	sums were paid to employees who remained in a company's service for a
24890	definite period of years. Again they were given a certain percentage of
24891	the annual profits. In other instances, employees were allowed to buy
24892	stock on easy terms and thus become part owners in the concern. This
24893	last plan was carried so far by a large soap manufacturing company that
24894	the employees, besides becoming stockholders, secured the right to elect
24895	representatives to serve on the board of directors who managed the
24896	entire business. So extensive had profit-sharing become by 1914 that the
24897	Federal Industrial Relations Committee, appointed by the President,
24898	deemed it worthy of a special study. Though opposed by regular trade
24899	unions, it was undoubtedly growing in popularity.
24900	
24901	=Labor Managers and Welfare Work.=--Another effort of employers to meet
24902	the problems of the new age appeared in the appointment of specialists,
24903	known as employment managers, whose task it was to study the relations
24904	existing between masters and workers and discover practical methods for
24905	dealing with each grievance as it arose. By 1918, hundreds of big
24906	companies had recognized this modern "profession" and universities were
24907	giving courses of instruction on the subject to young men and women. In
24908	that year a national conference of employment managers was held at
24909	Rochester, New York. The discussion revealed a wide range of duties
24910	assigned to managers, including questions of wages, hours, sanitation,
24911	rest rooms, recreational facilities, and welfare work of every kind
24912	designed to make the conditions in mills and factories safer and more
24913	humane. Thus it was evident that hundreds of employers had abandoned the
24914	old idea that they were dealing merely with individual employees and
24915	that their obligations ended with the payment of any wages they saw fit
24916	to fix. In short, they were seeking to develop a spirit of cooperation
24917	to take the place of competition and enmity; and to increase the
24918	production of commodities by promoting the efficiency and happiness of
24919	the producers.
24920	
24921	
24922	THE RISE AND GROWTH OF ORGANIZED LABOR
24923	
24924	=The American Federation of Labor.=--Meanwhile a powerful association of
24925	workers representing all the leading trades and crafts, organized into
24926	unions of their own, had been built up outside the control of employers.
24927	This was the American Federation of Labor, a nation-wide union of
24928	unions, founded in 1886 on the basis of beginnings made five years
24929	before. At the time of its establishment it had approximately 150,000
24930	members. Its growth up to the end of the century was slow, for the total
24931	enrollment in 1900 was only 300,000. At that point the increase became
24932	marked. The membership reached 1,650,000 in 1904 and more than 3,000,000
24933	in 1919. To be counted in the ranks of organized labor were several
24934	strong unions, friendly to the Federation, though not affiliated with
24935	it. Such, for example, were the Railway Brotherhoods with more than half
24936	a million members. By the opening of 1920 the total strength of
24937	organized labor was put at about 4,000,000 members, meaning, if we
24938	include their families, that nearly one-fifth of the people of the
24939	United States were in some positive way dependent upon the operations of
24940	trade unions.
24941	
24942	=Historical Background.=--This was the culmination of a long and
24943	significant history. Before the end of the eighteenth century, the
24944	skilled workmen--printers, shoemakers, tailors, and carpenters--had, as
24945	we have seen, formed local unions in the large cities. Between 1830 and
24946	1860, several aggressive steps were taken in the American labor
24947	movement. For one thing, the number of local unions increased by leaps
24948	and bounds in all the industrial towns. For another, there was
24949	established in every large manufacturing city a central labor body
24950	composed of delegates from the unions of the separate trades. In the
24951	local union the printers or the cordwainers, for example, considered
24952	only their special trade problems. In the central labor union, printers,
24953	cordwainers, iron molders, and other craftsmen considered common
24954	problems and learned to cooperate with one another in enforcing the
24955	demands of each craft. A third step was the federation of the unions of
24956	the same craftsmen in different cities. The printers of New York,
24957	Philadelphia, Boston, and other towns, for instance, drew together and
24958	formed a national trade union of printers built upon the local unions of
24959	that craft. By the eve of the Civil War there were four or five powerful
24960	national unions of this character. The expansion of the railway made
24961	travel and correspondence easier and national conventions possible even
24962	for workmen of small means. About 1834 an attempt was made to federate
24963	the unions of all the different crafts into a national organization; but
24964	the effort was premature.
24965	
24966	_The National Labor Union._--The plan which failed in 1834 was tried
24967	again in the sixties. During the war, industries and railways had
24968	flourished as never before; prices had risen rapidly; the demand for
24969	labor had increased; wages had mounted slowly, but steadily. Hundreds of
24970	new local unions had been founded and eight or ten national trade unions
24971	had sprung into being. The time was ripe, it seemed, for a national
24972	consolidation of all labor's forces; and in 1866, the year after the
24973	surrender of General Lee at Appomattox, the "National Labor Union" was
24974	formed at Baltimore under the leadership of an experienced organizer,
24975	W.H. Sylvis of the iron molders. The purpose of the National Labor Union
24976	was not merely to secure labor's standard demands touching hours, wages,
24977	and conditions of work or to maintain the gains already won. It leaned
24978	toward political action and radical opinions. Above all, it sought to
24979	eliminate the conflict between capital and labor by making workingmen
24980	the owners of shops through the formation of cooperative industries. For
24981	six years the National Labor Union continued to hold conferences and
24982	carry on its propaganda; but most of the cooperative enterprises failed,
24983	political dissensions arose, and by 1872 the experiment had come to an
24984	end.
24985	
24986	_The Knights of Labor._--While the National Labor Union was
24987	experimenting, there grew up in the industrial world a more radical
24988	organization known as the "Noble Order of the Knights of Labor." It was
24989	founded in Philadelphia in 1869, first as a secret society with rituals,
24990	signs, and pass words; "so that no spy of the boss can find his way into
24991	the lodge room to betray his fellows," as the Knights put it. In form
24992	the new organization was simple. It sought to bring all laborers,
24993	skilled and unskilled, men and women, white and colored, into a mighty
24994	body of local and national unions without distinction of trade or craft.
24995	By 1885, ten years after the national organization was established, it
24996	boasted a membership of over 700,000. In philosophy, the Knights of
24997	Labor were socialistic, for they advocated public ownership of the
24998	railways and other utilities and the formation of cooperative societies
24999	to own and manage stores and factories.
